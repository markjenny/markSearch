	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">She's the boss</h2>
    <p><a href="http://ti.me/1nuefYr" target="_blank">Beyonc&eacute;</a> doesn&rsquo;t just sit at the table. She builds a better one. Today she sits at the head of the boardroom table at Parkwood Entertainment.</p>
<p>In December, she took the world by surprise when she released a new album, complete with videos, and announced it on Facebook and Instagram. <em>Beyonc&eacute;</em> shattered music-industry rules &mdash; and sales records.</p>
<p>One song includes words by novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: &ldquo;We say to girls, &lsquo;You can have ambition, but not too much.&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; Beyonc&eacute; has insisted that girls &ldquo;run the world&rdquo; and declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bossy, I&rsquo;m the boss.&rdquo; She raises her voice both on- and offstage to urge women to be independent and lead.</p>
<p>In the past year, Beyonc&eacute; has sold out the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour while being a full-time mother. Her secret: hard work, honesty and authenticity. And her answer to the question, What would you do if you weren&rsquo;t afraid? appears to be &ldquo;Watch me. I&rsquo;m about to do it.&rdquo; Then she adds, &ldquo;You can, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a href="http://time.com/74436/beyonce-pretty-hurts-music-video/" target="_blank">The official video for Beyonc&eacute;&#8217;s &#8220;Pretty Hurts&#8221;</a></p>

And if the votes hadn&rsquo;t been there, then we would have had to start over, but at least give it a shot. And he didn&rsquo;t do it. And the fact that a year-and-a-half has gone by means that time has been wasted&mdash;and during that time families have been separated, and during that time businesses have been harmed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Obama said lawmakers who question his authority to act have a simple recourse: passing a comprehensive immigration bill for his signature. &#8220;When members of Congress question my authority to make our immigration system work better, I have a simple answer: pass a bill,&#8221; Obama said as the audience cheered and chanted &#8220;Si, se puede.&#8221; &#8220;Pass a bill. Pass a bill. Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600463\"><\/div>\n<p>Before deplaning Air Force One, Obama signed two memoranda to develop policies to better help integrate immigrants into the United States and improve the immigration visa system. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security released memoranda on efforts to improve border security, end the controversial &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; program and employ prosecutorial discretion to allowing many illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. &#8220;Under this revised policy, those who entered illegally prior to January 1, 2014, who never disobeyed a prior order of removal, and were never convicted of a serious offense, will not be priorities for removal,&#8221; the department said of a policy that will take effect on Jan. 5, 2015. DHS also announced that it would begin accepting applications within the next 180 day for the expanded deferred action program, which would allow millions of immigrants to remain in the U.S. legally for three years on a renewable basis.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said he understood the worries of those concerned about the impact of immigration on their jobs and the &#8220;fabric of our country,&#8221; but said he also heard the concerns of the so-called Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and of the American citizens with family members who immigrated illegally to be near them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American dream,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re a nation that finds a way to welcome them. We make them earn it, but we welcome them in as fellow human beings, fellow children of God, and we harness their talents to make the future brighter for everybody.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The executive actions put pressure on Republicans who have strenuously objected to Obama&#8217;s process, while the substance of his announcements places the GOP in a bind with an ever-more-diverse presidential electorate.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600463\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Obama%20Touts%20Immigration%20Actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20%7C%20TIME&body=Obama%20Touts%20Immigration%20Actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas%0A%0ARaucuous%20crowd%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20cheers%20%22Si%2C%20se%20puede%22%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6DZ&text=Obama%20touts%20immigration%20actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F&title=Obama+Touts+Immigration+Actions+in+Las+Vegas\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600463\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600463\/immigration-reform-obama-executive-actions\/\" data-title=\"Obama Touts Immigration Actions in Las Vegas\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Hill, who alleges that as an actress on Cosby&rsquo;s educational television segments, <em>Picture Pages, <\/em>in the &rsquo;80s, she was drugged and suspects that she was sexually assaulted by Cosby starting when she was 15. Hill says that at the age, she began an on-again, off-again relationship with Cosby, who would offer her drinks that Hill now believes were drugged.<\/p>\n<div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"body-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"main-white\">\n<section class=\"page-columns\">\n<section class=\"two-column columns-left\">\n<article id=\"main-story\">\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>&ldquo;One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Hill told<em> CBS Pittsburgh<\/em>. &ldquo;I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned, you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hill eventually ended the relationship when she was 19, despite Cosby paying for Hill&rsquo;s college tuition.<\/p>\n<p>Another woman, Kristina Ruehli, also alleges that she was drugged by Cosby when she was 22, working at a talent agency assistant at Artists Agency Corp, where he was then a client. Ruehli was one of the women named in Andrea Constand&rsquo;s lawsuit against Cosby that was eventually settled.<\/p>\n<p>According to an interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/news\/2014\/11\/21\/kristina-ruehli-says-bill-cosby-drugged-tried-sexually-assault-1965\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Philadelphia Magazine<\/em><\/a>, Cosby invited Ruehli to an after party at his house, who was surprised to find that she was the only guest when she arrived. After drinking the drink that Cosby offered to her, Ruehli found herself disoriented and losing consciousness.<\/p>\n<div class=\"copy-paste-block\">\n<div class=\"copy-paste-block\">\n<p>&ldquo;It was all foggy, and I woke up in the bed. I found myself on the bed, and he had his shirt off. He had unzipped his pants. I was just coming to,&rdquo; Ruehli told <em>Philadelphia Magazine<\/em>. &ldquo;He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head. He had his cock out, and he had my head pushed close enough to it &mdash; I just remember looking at his stomach hair. And the hair on his chest. I had never seen a black man naked before.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Ruehli said that she threw up and left Cosby&rsquo;s house, and decided to come forward to add credibility to the sexual assault allegations that have been growing hour by hour.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need money or aggravation,&rdquo; Ruehli added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very wealthy, so I have nothing to gain. But I wanted to come forward to tell the truth to back up other people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a

Meanwhile, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, further boosted global investors&rsquo; confidence by saying the central bank is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/11\/21\/markets-usa-bonds-idUSL2N0TB2EZ20141121\" target=\"_blank\">prepared to step up efforts<\/a> to give the struggling eurozone economy a much-needed shot in the arm.<\/p>\n<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 91 points, or 0.5%, to finish at a new record close of 17,810. The blue-chip index, which also set a new intraday high by flirting with the 17,900-point mark, hit a record close two out of five days this week after recording new all-time high finishes three times last week.<\/p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 also posted another record close Friday by rising almost 11 points, or 0.5%, to 2,064. It was the closely-watched index&rsquo;s third record finish of the week after posting three new records last week, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite was up slightly, gaining 11 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 4,713. The tech-heavy index continues to climb to its highest levels since 2000.<\/p>\n<p>One of Friday&rsquo;s best-performing stocks was auction house Sotheby&rsquo;s, which jumped nearly 7% following news of its <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/21\/sothebys-ceo-steps-down-after-an-extended-activist-investor-battle\/\" target=\"_blank\">CEO&rsquo;s departure<\/a> after a long battle with activist investors.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, it was a week of moderate gains for the U.S. market. But it did mark the fifth-straight week of positive performance coming on the heels of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/14\/stock-market-fourth-weekly-gain\/\" target=\"_blank\">best four-week stretch<\/a> since 2011. Earlier this week, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/18\/stock-market-record-close-health-care\/\" target=\"_blank\">the markets improved<\/a> on news that Japan&rsquo;s prime minister would delay tax hikes for 18 months in the hopes of stimulating that country&rsquo;s sluggish economy.<\/p>\n<p>The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 were both up by about 1% on the week, while the Nasdaq gained just 0.5% over the past five days.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the major indices has rebounded sharply after a series of market-wide sell-offs in early October <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/10\/dow-jones-down-volatile-three-weeks\/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly erased<\/a> all of the year&rsquo;s gains as investors showed their concerns over the global

themselves insisting that the former Secretary of State&rsquo;s ascendancy should not be considered &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; while at other moments they discussed in great detail the organizational structure, fundraising and messaging efforts that are already in place to buttress her 2016 campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez said that ambivalence as a result of the pummeling Clinton&rsquo;s campaign received six years ago, when many Democrats considered her a shoo-in as the Democratic nominee.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 2008, we got eviscerated by a better campaign on the ground,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Lessons have been learned. So there has been extraordinary preparation and it&rsquo;s a very, very different, far more sophisticated operation that&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s ready for her, should she decide to run.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Adam Parkhomenko, who founded the organizational group Ready for Hillary, which has spent the last two years collecting a database of roughly 3 million supporters, echoed the sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been doing this since January 2013 if I thought she was inevitable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We learned in 2008 she&rsquo;s not inevitable. No one&rsquo;s inevitable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie Schriock, the head of EMILY&rsquo;s List, who is expected to play a major role in a future Clinton campaign, said she looks forward to a &ldquo;healthy primary.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As everyone goes through a presidential primary process, it&rsquo;ll be the candidate who make the case,&rdquo; she said, adding that Clinton, while clearly the front-runner, will not be immune to that process. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing inevitable about 2016.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600300\"><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, several Clinton backers, including Schriock, former Obama campaign organizer Mitch Stewart, Correct the Record&#8217;s David Brock, and political strategist Chris Lehane, spoke directly about what organizations would have to work together on the ground to make a 2016 Clinton campaign most effective, what issues Clinton would be most likely to emphasize, and what message the campaign would be built around. All agreed that a hypothetical Clinton campaign will likely to focus on working class voters, who are feeling increasingly marginalized in today&rsquo;s economy.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton must project a vision for &ldquo;economic opportunity for American families,&rdquo; said Schriock. That&rsquo;s a phrase she used, with slight variations, twice more during a half-hour talk with reporters. The campaign will likely focus on connecting with working class voters, women, Hispanics and the African American community over issues like equal pay, minimum wage and leveling the playing field for the middle class, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Nina Turner, an Ohio state senator, said that a Clinton campaign could easily motivate key voting blocs, like the African American community, by staking progressive positions on issues like prison reform or creating more economic opportunities for the working poor. But, she said, &ldquo;This is not about a coronation for anybody.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Stewart agreed that &ldquo;a hypothetical Clinton campaign&rdquo; would have to focus primarily economic issues. &ldquo;We have to come up with an economic message that shows working class voters that we&rsquo;re on their side,&rdquo; said Stewart.<\/p>\n<p>When asked what issues would put Clinton in the strongest position against other potential Democratic contenders, such Martin O&#8217;Malley, Bernie Sanders, or Jim Webb, who announced yesterday that he was exploring the possibility of running, Stewart demurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to comment on any hypothetical candidate,&rdquo; said Stewart, laughing. &ldquo;Except my specific hypothetical candidate.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600300\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Hillary%E2%80%99s%202016%20Campaign%20is%20Ready%2C%20Hypothetically%20Speaking%20%7C%20TIME&body=Hillary%E2%80%99s%202016%20Campaign%20is%20Ready%2C%20Hypothetically%20Speaking%0A%0AWould-be%20surrogates%20tried%20to%20make%20the%20case%20for%20Hillary%20without%20admitting%20she%27s%20running%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6Bm&text=Hillary%27s%202016%20campaign%20is%20ready%2C%20hypothetically%20speaking&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F&title=Hillary%E2%80%99s+2016+Campaign+is+Ready%2C+Hypothetically+Speaking\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600300\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600300\/hillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary\/\" data-title=\"Hillary&amp;#8217;s 2016 Campaign is Ready, Hypothetically Speaking\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

The hotels will load their room types, availability and pricing information onto Amazon and pay the company a 15% commission, Skift reports. Hoteliers would receive their payments for the room from Amazon, and could negotiate a lower commission.<\/p>\n<p>One advantage for Amazon is that it could combine information about a traveler&#8217;s

intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.<\/p>\n<p>The House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week. Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel. The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May.<\/p>\n<p>The attacks in Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, and two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. A Libyan extremist, Ahmed Abu Khatalla, is facing trial on murder charges after he was captured in Libya and taken to the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to &#8220;stand down&#8221; after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600698\"><\/div>\n<p>The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents, reviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings,&#8221; said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the committee&#8217;s chairman, and Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the ranking Democrat, in a joint statement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from Benghazi and Tripoli as well as eight security personnel on the ground in Benghazi that night. Based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed, we concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their actions saved lives,&#8221; they said.<\/p>\n<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who serves on the intelligence panel and the Benghazi select committee, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s my hope that this report will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and answered yet again, and that the Benghazi Select Committee will accept these findings and instead focus its attention on the State Department&#8217;s progress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our fast response capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of the harshest charges have been leveled at Rice, now Obama&#8217;s national security adviser, who represented the Obama administration on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the attack. Rice repeated talking points that wrongly described a protest over a video deemed offensive to Muslims.<\/p>\n<p>But Rice&#8217;s comments were based on faulty intelligence from multiple agencies, according to the report. Analysts received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi, the report said &mdash;14 from the Open Source Center, which reviews news reports; one from the CIA; two from the Defense Department; and four from the National Security Agency.<\/p>\n<p>In the years since, some participants in the attack have said they were motivated by the video. The attackers were a mix of extremists and hangers on, the investigation found.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To this day,&#8221; the report said, &#8220;significant intelligence gaps regarding the identities, affiliations and motivations of the attackers remain.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600698\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories%20%7C%20TIME&body=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6HM&text=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F&title=House+Intel+Panel+Debunks+Many+Benghazi+Theories\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600698\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600698\/house-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories\/\" data-title=\"House Intel Panel Debunks Many Benghazi Theories\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

But the results, published online today in the<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/em>, show that <strong>the mobile phone data were better at predicting friendship than the subjects themselves.<\/strong> Thirty-two pairs of subjects switched from calling each other acquaintances to friends in the traditionally gathered survey data. These are most likely new relationships that formed during the course of the study, say the researchers, and they left a clear signal in the mobile phone data. Friends call each other far more often than acquaintances do when they are off-campus and during weekends. <strong>The pattern is so distinct that the researchers spotted budding friendships in the phone data months before the people themselves called themselves friends.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another great <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748704547604576263261679848814.html\" target=\"_blank\">article<\/a> in the WSJ by Robert Lee Hotz about how scientists are using phone data to study our behavior &mdash; and learning more than they ever thought they could:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&hellip;at MIT, scientists who tracked student cellphones during the latest presidential election were able to deduce that two people were talking about politics, even though the researchers didn&rsquo;t know the content of the conversation. By analyzing changes in movement and communication patterns, researchers could also detect flu symptoms before the students themselves realized they were getting sick.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Phones can know,&rdquo; said Dr. Pentland, director of MIT&rsquo;s Human Dynamics Laboratory, who helped pioneer the research. &ldquo;People can get this god&rsquo;s-eye view of human behavior.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, companies are very interested in this data:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Cellphone providers are openly exploring other possibilities. <strong>By mining their calling records for social relationships among customers, several European telephone companies discovered that people were five times more likely to switch carriers if a friend had already switched, said Mr. Eagle, who works with the firms. The companies now selectively target people for special advertising based on friendships with people who dropped the service.<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600178\"><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<p>And some of the results are downright unnerving:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>After analyzing more than 16 million records of call date, time and position, the researchers determined that, taken together, people&rsquo;s movements appeared to follow a mathematical pattern.<\/strong> <em><strong>The scientists said that, with enough information about past movements, they could forecast someone&rsquo;s future whereabouts with 93.6% accuracy.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The pattern held true whether people stayed close to home or traveled widely, and wasn&rsquo;t affected by the phone user&rsquo;s age or gender.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A few other interesting tidbits:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Overall, our phones <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakadesuyo.com\/does-technology-make-us-more-or-less-happy\" target=\"_blank\">make us happier<\/a>.

Twelve pieces are on display right now at the Kreeger Museum in Washington, D.C., including my all-time favorite, &#8220;Lament.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So the road started early for me. Telling stories. Communicating a message. Developing my voice in this evolving medium over the course of more than two decades. Sometimes there is no way to take a different path when it is what you love &mdash; even when it doesn&#8217;t love you back.<\/p>\n<p>I trudged through 10 years in local news, worked overnights at CBS News for four years, hosted a cable show for women for two years after that until finally settling into what I thought would be a life-long career as a correspondent for CBS News. My first week on the job was 9\/11. I traveled America finding stories for &#8220;The CBS Evening News,&#8221; &#8220;CBS Sunday Morning,&#8221; even &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; Anchoring the CBS Evening News Sunday edition felt like a feather in my cap.<\/p>\n<p>Just shy of my 40th birthday, the road ended. I was called down to the office of the President of CBS News and was told, &#8220;They were moving in a different direction.&#8221; I was being fired. I. Was. Fired. They liked my work&hellip; but didn&#8217;t like it anymore&hellip; or just had other people coming in&#8230; Whatever it was, my days at CBS News had abruptly come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Being fired is an out-of-body experience. I remember it like it was yesterday. A mixture of anger, feeling victimized, feeling exhilarated and free, and feeling scared shitless all at once. But then the time starts to pass, and if you are like I was, the NEXT job couldn&#8217;t come soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>I sent my work to other networks and the response was&hellip; crickets. I went from everything to everyone to nothing to no one. If I did get an interview, the first question was: Why were you fired? I didn&#8217;t have an answer because I didn&#8217;t really know. Each job interview set me deeper back; deeper into knowing it was over. It&#8217;s hard to fight nothing. No phone ringing. No calls back. Just &#8220;No thank you,&#8221; from everywhere I applied. I would re-apply six months later. Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I did get an audition to anchor the local news at the ABC affiliate in Washington. I was told I was close&#8230; down to three. I went for the audition and was desperate for the job. So desperate it was written all over my face. They gave it to the talented Alison Starling who is still there to this day.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600691\"><\/div>\n<p>At about nine months of nothing, with severance running out, I knew I had to find another road. I began the task of applying for any job anywhere. I was overqualified for many jobs I applied for online, but still got no calls. Slowly&#8230; ever so slowly, I got responses from a few major PR firms. One, just one, called me in for an interview. I had the skills and the experience to do PR well.<\/p>\n<p>It was at this time that a good friend &mdash; a talented producer at CBS News &mdash; was in the process of getter fired too (or &#8220;released from her contract&#8221;). The turnover was continuing there and this time, it was my friend&#8217;s turn. Since I had been through it, I was coaching her through the process &mdash; the hurt, the anger, the loss, the fear. I was reliving it all with her. Knowing the place and the players, it really was like my loss all over again. She was one of the best producers there and had taught me everything I know about voice control, studio tracking and storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>My job interview turned into another one until it was down to a final round. A job as a VP at a major PR firm. Real money. It was the kind of money that would keep the family moving forward. We were at a dead stop with no hope in sight. This job was a potential lifeline&hellip; right there for the taking.<\/p>\n<p>I was waiting for the call to line up the last round. I&#8217;ll never forget the moment. Driving my pickup up the hill near my house, the &#8217;93 Ford 150 with roll-up windows just stopped&hellip; Stalled out and died. I knew that meant another $500 at the shop. $500 that I did not have. Then my cell phone rings. It&#8217;s the PR firm. Wanting to know if I can come in this week&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>I put the truck in park in the middle of the road and listened to myself as I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to come in but I have to be honest; I know someone better for the job. Perfect actually.&#8221; I then began to sing the praises of my soon-to-be fired friend. It came out of my mouth as if I had been practicing it forever&hellip; So easy to say, because it was true. She was perfect for the job, and I was not. I knew this road, as much as I needed one, would not be taken by me.<\/p>\n<p>I remember clunking my head on the steering wheel after I hung up asking myself: &#8220;Why, WHY?? You need a job so badly!&#8221; But I knew it even then. There was still only one road for me&hellip; and that this one wasn&#8217;t it. I knew even then I would have to find my way back to that road I chose at 13 years old. Somehow.<\/p>\n<p>It took many more months, but I called every network known to man and begged for ANY job they had available.

A Black American woman. I would be so jealous if I were anything else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I learned that &ldquo;Black&rdquo; was intended to mean &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; at the age of five and by the time I was ready for college I had only begun to learn why I should rejoice in my Blackness. I grew up in this spirit. I survived being &ldquo;the smart Black girl&rdquo; at majority white schools in this spirit, and rejected an opportunity for full scholarship at a predominately white institution to attend the best university on the globe (naturally a historically black one) &#8212; because of this spirit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Being a Black person at an HBCU is nothing short of divine. A community of academics who understand you, instructors who are exceptionally hard on you because they know what you&rsquo;re up against in this world, and an ever-present aura that dispels every negative thing that you were taught about your color from the moment you knew what it was.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I chopped off my chemically processed hair, took every class I could led by the master of Africana Studies, Dr. Gregory Carr, and wore an ankh on my body every chance I got.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Needless to say, I only dated Black men.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I find Black men physically attractive, what I really, really find attractive is the unspoken understanding that exists between me and a Black man of my choosing. I love not explaining why I tie my hair up at night, or that my skin would burn in beach sun without sunblock. I love arguing about whether &ldquo;Love Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love and Basketball&rdquo; was the greatest Black love story of the &rsquo;90s. I could never date outside of Black men, I thought. It would never work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But I was W-R-O-N-G! I could and I did.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">We&rsquo;ll call him Mazzi for discretion&rsquo;s sake. He stood about 6 feet and 5 inches. He was handsome, funny, and a bit cynical. We worked in the same space, after I had graduated from college, for about a year. I hardly noticed him at the onset but eventually we began talking and sharing inside jokes and such. And one day he asked me on a date.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">There was naturally some apprehension: 1) because we worked together AND 2) because he was unquestionably a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I expressed my desire to keep it quiet at work and Mazzi agreed, so we went.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I laughed a lot that evening. Like from pick-up to drop-off. As our dates went on for some months, I began to notice the disapproving eyes of people around us when we were out together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Do you see how people look at us?!&rdquo; I asked one day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said nonchalantly. &ldquo;It happens all the time. People don&rsquo;t have shit going on in their own lives so that fact that I&rsquo;m here with this &lsquo;self-aware&rsquo; Black woman is earth shattering to them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He smiled cautiously.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Time passed and we grew closer. I had just gotten into running and he was a thrower for his college&rsquo;s track team so he would offer me advice on what I can do to get faster and stronger (he also gave awesome back rubs). He was a writer who never put his thoughts down and I encouraged him to do so. He had become my sounding board when I would get overwhelmed and met disappointments in my medical school application process, and I was his &ldquo;therapist&rdquo; who eventually got to the root of his cynicism. We were comfortable with one another. At some point in all this, I changed jobs to work in my field and we no longer had the &ldquo;work thing&rdquo; to consider.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600604\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Here I was: Ms. HBCU, Afro-turned locs sporting, ankh wearing, and lover of all things Black &mdash; falling for a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">He brought up the subject of a relationship and I retreated. I&rsquo;d talk about my reluctance to get in relationships (which was true) and he didn&rsquo;t push the issue. But of course eventually I entered a relationship with him because it only made sense.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My two closest friends were shocked but very supportive and liked him a lot. I liked him too. He was the ideal, except he wasn&rsquo;t Black.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My family slowly began to pick up on the fact that this was more than a collection of dates and did not necessarily approve. This didn&rsquo;t impact me so much though. I was good at being rebellious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">His family was really sweet to me and always invited and included me when going to dinners or family parties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I never felt &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; throughout the course of our relationship, race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I remember the first time it was brought to my attention. He was driving and talking to me on the phone with some friends in the car. His friends had been drinking one of them yelled into the phone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Tell Ashley I miss her! Wait! Do Black people miss people?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Now you and I both know how idiotic of a statement that was, but my issue was not with his asshole of a friend, it was with his lack of response to the comment. He later told me he addressed it. I didn&rsquo;t believe him.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">When I would experience &ldquo;exotic otherness&rdquo; at work, I would talk to him about it and he would suggest that I was overreacting when I knew I wasn&rsquo;t. He would never know the feeling I was describing and I really couldn&rsquo;t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/issues\/white-privilege-ferguson\"> expect him to understand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Then once in an argument, he said that my beloved alma mater was &ldquo;institutionally racist.&rdquo; This was a HUGE mistake on his part. I don&rsquo;t remember my exact response but I am certain it was angry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">These were tough issues we had to work through. And it was hard. In considering a future with him, I worried about these issues. And he got to a point where he would refuse to talk if he sensed that race would come up. I understood, it was tense between us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But when it was good, which usually was the case, it was perfect. Then, during a period that I thought was a good one, he went through my phone while I was sleeping. He read messages between my friends and me about how I missed the comfort and familiarity of Black men&#8230; OUCH!<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">To know me is to know that a violation of my privacy is grounds for dismissal. I felt guilty, so I didn&rsquo;t break up with him right way. But from that point forward, I stopped feeling like myself. I was no longer mentally present in the relationship and I strongly resented the phone incident. The race thing was too hard and I had stopped &ldquo;trying&rdquo; because I knew he didn&rsquo;t trust me anyway. I ended it a few months later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">This was in August. And I would be fooling myself if I said I don&rsquo;t sometimes think I made a mistake.

In the U.S., it was &#8220;the worst time to be queer because you are not being ignored, you are actively searched for and persecuted,&#8221; said John D&#8217;Emilio, a professor of gay and lesbian studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &#8220;The nice thing about the movie is that it is calling attention to this bit of history that people don&rsquo;t know anything about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596955\/the-price-of-genius\/\" target=\"_blank\">The price of genius<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In Britain&mdash;where America&#8217;s own sodomy laws originated&mdash;the story begins in 1533, during the reign of Henry the VIII. That year, the Buggery Act made male sex a capital offense in Britain, punishable by death, usually by hanging. That remained the law until 1861, when the sentence was changed from death to prison, usually with hard labor. In 1885, the law was broadened to criminalize &#8220;gross indecency&#8221; a vague, catch-all term used to prosecute anything considered to be deviant sexual behavior outside of sodomy, mostly between men. In 1895, the playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years of prison and hard labor, about which he penned a poem called &#8220;The Balad of Reading Gaol.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During Alan Turing&#8217;s life, public concern over the possibility that homosexuals serving in the military or aiding in the war effort could be blackmailed by enemies intensified the stigma of homosexuality in Britain. After Turing was convicted in 1952, the British government took away his security clearance. Turing was exposed after he reported a petty theft to the police, involving his lover. Their relationship was discovered by the police through his reporting of the crime. He pleaded guilty and opted for hormone treatments, known as chemical castration, instead of prison time. He tragically killed himself with cyanide in 1954.<\/p>\n<p>The 1950s, was the beginning of the end for Britain&#8217;s laws against homosexual sex, as the prosecution of prominent people stoked a public backlash against the laws. In 1954, a well known journalist, Peter Wildeblood was convicted of homosexual acts with two prominent and wealthy men, Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, in a public trial that resulted in prison time for all of the men and public opposition to laws against homosexual sex. The trial lead to the creation of the Wolfenden committee of government representatives, ministers, educators, and psychiatrists, which in 1957, published a report recommending the discontinuation of laws against homosexuality.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599607\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3594876\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>The report eventually led to the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, which ended the criminalization of homosexual sex between consenting men over the age of 21 in Britain and Wales. In 1994, the age was lowered to 18, and in 2003, it was lowered to 16, the same age for consenting heterosexual sex.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. history is slightly different from Britain&#8217;s. The fervent prosecution of gay sex didn&#8217;t start to happen in earnest until the very period during which Turing lived. The U.S. had anti-sodomy laws inherited from the English settlers, but it wasn&#8217;t until the late 1930s, 40s and 50s, during a period coinciding with the World Wars and a strong strain of Christian morality, that police in the U.S. made it a priority to enforce laws against homosexuals.<\/p>\n<p>As in England, concerns that homosexuals could be blackmailed by Communist spies&mdash;an idea popularized by Senator Joe McCarthy&mdash;drove some of the fervor against homosexuals during that period. In the U.S.&mdash;more so than in Britain, it seems&mdash;the period was marked by increased police enforcement of the laws. Police officers went undercover in public parks where homosexuals went to meet each other for sexual encounters, in order to uncover them. It was a period of fear for homosexuals in America unparalleled before or since. &#8220;This is the height of what I call the homosexual terror in America,&#8221; said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of<em> Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596961\/review-the-imitation-game\/\" target=\"_blank\">TIME reviews <em>The Imitation Game<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>During this same period, Eskridge said, states began to pass laws that allowed courts to institutionalize gay people indefinitely in mental institutions for having &#8220;psychotic personalities,&#8221; where were experimented on, lobotomized, and given shock therapy.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case with Turing, the prosecution of gays also denied the U.S. some very bright minds who, but for their homosexuality, might have been allowed to contribute more to society. In the late 1950&#8242;s, Frank Kameny, an astronomer with a Ph.D. from Harvard, was kicked out of the Army Map Service and barred from serving in theUS government because he was a homosexual.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of geniuses of 20th century, the father of modern computers who helped win World War II, who was a lovely person, was destroyed by the anti homosexual terror,&#8221; Eskridge said of Turing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3558879\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%20%7C%20TIME&body=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%0A%0AAlan%20Turing%20wasn%27t%20the%20only%20one%20who%20suffered%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6qb&text=The%20history%20behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%27s%20The%20Imitation%20Game&via=TIMEHistory\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F&title=The+History+Behind+Benedict+Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s+The+Imitation+Game\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3599607\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599607\/imitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing\/\" data-title=\"The History Behind Benedict Cumberbatch&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;\/i&gt;\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"History","slug":"history","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/history\/","description":"The news in context, from the archives of TIME.

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.<\/p>\n<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?<\/p>\n<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2014\/11\/19\/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">decided there was not sufficient evidence<\/a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/articles\/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde\/\">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde<\/a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599631\"><\/div>\n<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know<\/em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.<\/p>\n<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.<\/p>\n<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission.

His office pointed to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/remarks-president-comprehensive-immigration-reform\">2010 Obama statement<\/a> in which the President said that providing undocumented workers legal status &ldquo;could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The action by the President yesterday will only encourage more people to come here illegally and put their lives at risk,&rdquo; said Boehner. &ldquo;We saw the humanitarian crisis on our border last summer&mdash;how horrific it was. Well next summer, it could be worse.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Boehner was referring to a surge in unaccompanied minors from October 2013 through September, when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/newsroom\/stats\/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children-2014\">over 68,000<\/a> unaccompanied minors crossed the southwest border, a 77% increase over the previous year. (The number of children coming over has sharply declined in the past few months.)<\/p>\n<p>But Doris Meissner, the director of the Migration Policy Institute&#8217;s immigration policy work, said that Boehner&#8217;s criticism was off. Here&#8217;s what she told TIME:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It goes to the more general idea of whether a legal status program functions as a magnet to future illegal immigration and that&rsquo;s always something that&rsquo;s been out there and has been a concern, but the reality today is that we have invested so much in southwest border enforcement&hellip;and the President has underscored that again that he is going to allocate even more additional resources to border enforcement. The evidence that we have is that our illegal immigration across the southwest border is at it&rsquo;s lowest level since the early 1970s when the current wave of illegal immigration largely from Mexico began, we have net minus immigration from Mexico.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600239\"><\/div>\n<p>The child migrant spurt that happened over the last year was much more a function of conditions in those three countries&mdash;Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador&mdash;and notion of &#8216;permisos&#8217; in the United States. But that&rsquo;s now really receded dramatically. So if you take the spurt of Central American crossings out of the numbers for last year, you find the lowest levels of illegal immigration apprehensions across the southwest border in decades. Now that&rsquo;s not to say that you can discount Central American migration but&#8230;it&rsquo;s a function of different circumstances then the illegal immigration that has led to what the President is saying now.<\/p>\n<p>This action that he has taken now is retrospective. You have to have been in the country for five years to qualify for it. It&rsquo;s for people as of the date of announcement; there&rsquo;s no eligibility for people that might be coming forward in the future. I do think that the underpinnings today are quite different and it&rsquo;s pretty hard to make the case that this particular action would spur a future migration.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600239\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Obama%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Increase%20Illegal%20Immigration%2C%20Expert%20Says%20%7C%20TIME&body=Obama%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Increase%20Illegal%20Immigration%2C%20Expert%20Says%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6An&text=Obama%27s%20actions%20won%27t%20increase%20illegal%20immigration%2C%20expert%20says.&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F&title=Obama%E2%80%99s+Actions+Won%E2%80%99t+Increase+Illegal+Immigration%2C+Expert+Says\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600239\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600239\/obama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert\/\" data-title=\"Obama&amp;#8217;s Actions Won&amp;#8217;t Increase Illegal Immigration, Expert Says\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>osby Show<\/i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?<\/p>\n<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.<\/p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>harm anyone, even indirectly?<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599978\/cosby-show-reruns-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599394\"><\/div>\n<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son<\/em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596545\/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">silence<\/a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599394\"><\/div><\/aside><aside

Making stuff that counts is rare. Making beautiful products, with a user experience that&rsquo;s intuitive for all, while rocking the world of business almost never happens. I know how hard this is, as combining design, engineering and entrepreneurship has been a common calling I&rsquo;ve shared with Tony Fadell since our 20s. &ldquo;A passionate, brilliant engineer&rdquo; is what I remember people saying about Tony in Silicon Valley in the &rsquo;90s, but that is just scraping the surface.<\/p>\n<p>Tony did all this, at least twice: with our music as the father of the iPod, which he led at Apple; and with the Nest Labs thermostat, the company he founded four years ago and recently sold to Google. And did I mention his central role in the development of the iPhone?<\/p>\n<p>Some people spend their entire lives hoping for one breakthrough that counts, one that truly makes a difference in the human experience. At 45, Tony has two of these under his belt, or three &mdash; who&rsquo;s counting?

This connection led to an opportunity to hold a solo exhibition in Doha. Upon accepting the offer, I made my first trip to Qatar&rsquo;s capital, and the sight of the vast futuristic city unfolding in the desert set my imagination aflame.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next two years, I learned quite a bit about Sheika al-Mayassa, the organization she chairs &mdash; the Qatar Museums Authority &mdash; and the common threads among the cultures of the Asian continent. Sheika al-Mayassa, sister of the Emir, has chosen to use the resources at her disposal to give her people access to the world&rsquo;s best art and to promote intercultural understanding. This choice is not an easy one, nor should it be taken for granted. Coming from Japan, where art that is challenging in nature faces an opposition that at times feels institutional, I am highly moved by her vision and her strong passion for art.<\/p>\n<p><em>Murakami

I knew from our first conversation that he was that person.<\/p>\n<p>I will never forget how free and fun those sessions were. There were no rules, loads of laughs and music being created that made you feel like you could levitate. The collaboration I have with him is like no other. He made me fearless, and I&rsquo;ve carried that with me the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what Pharrell does. He injects that vibrant energy into the music in a way that you can feel.

Aliko is a big reason why.<\/p>\n<p><em>Gates is co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Aliko%20Dangote%20%7C%20TIME&body=Aliko%20Dangote%0A%0AAfrica%27s%20richest%20man%20who%20does%20good%20in%20addition%20to%20doing%20well%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70903%2Faliko-dangote-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70903%2Faliko-dangote-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlXOJ&text=Aliko%20Dangote%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70903%2Faliko-dangote-2014-time-100%2F&title=Aliko+Dangote\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70903\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70903\/aliko-dangote-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Aliko Dangote\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/aliko-dangote-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/aliko-dangote-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/aliko-dangote-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/aliko-dangote-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/aliko-dangote-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Illustration by Michael Hoeweler for TIME","caption":"","alt":"Aliko Dangote TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70903,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70903%2Faliko-dangote-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlXOJ","encoded_title":"Aliko+Dangote","twitter_text":"Aliko%20Dangote%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Aliko%20Dangote%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Aliko%20Dangote%0A%0AAfrica%27s%20richest%20man%20who%20does%20good%20in%20addition%20to%20doing%20well%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70903%2Faliko-dangote-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70903\/aliko-dangote-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70710,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/aliko-dangote-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=58px%2C92px%2C526px%2C526px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"TITANS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/titans\/","slug":"titans"},"collection_byline":"Bill Gates","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70910\/serena-williams-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlXON","title":"Serena Williams","friendly_title":"Serena Williams","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Serena Williams","excerpt":"The champion who won't give up","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 20:17:25","updated":"2014-04-24 00:17:25","minute":"8:17 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>I first met Serena over a decade ago in Miami when I joined the Heat. Since then, I&rsquo;ve watched her grow and dominate in her sport, overcoming adversity to win title after title. There is no doubt that she has made an incredible impact on the world of tennis, but it&rsquo;s her determination to never give up that has always resonated with me.<\/p>\n<p>Serena is a friend, but I also look up to her as a fellow athlete. I respect her relentless work ethic, focus, drive and discipline. I understand what it&rsquo;s like to sustain injuries and the fight it takes to come back from them. I admire her ability to fight and how she has defied the odds with sheer determination and heart.<\/p>\n<p>On the court, Serena is a warrior. An aggressive and competitive nature combined with passion, drive and skill makes her a formidable and fierce opponent. Off the court, she is a sweetheart, a bright light with an infectious spirit. She is extremely humble and cherishes her family and life.<\/p>\n<p>Serena does not take her abilities for granted. She deserves all of her success, because she is one of the most hardworking and disciplined people I know. She is a world-class athlete and a true champion in every sense of the word. Serena is on a mission &mdash; and how amazing that we all get to witness it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"3\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3496841550001-3\"

It was she who famously said, &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s rights are human rights.&rdquo; She not only spoke those words, but also dedicated her life to empowering women around the world through politics and philanthropy. She has been a source of strength for many women leaders, including myself, my family and those who stood by me after I was attacked. &ldquo;Continue your mission, be strong, we believe in you&rdquo; is what she said to me, my father and the rest of the Malala Fund team when we met her last year at the Clinton Global Initiative awards. Her life and leadership show women what we can achieve if we believe in our own strength and if we channel our inner creativity, compassion and determination. A world with more women leaders will be a better world, and Hillary Clinton is helping make that possible.<\/p>\n<p><em>Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist who defied the Taliban to attend school and is a co-founder of the Malala Fund<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Hillary%20Clinton%20%7C%20TIME&body=Hillary%20Clinton%0A%0AThe%20advocate%20for%20women%20leaders%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70904%2Fhillary-clinton-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70904%2Fhillary-clinton-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlY55&text=Hillary%20Clinton%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70904%2Fhillary-clinton-2014-time-100%2F&title=Hillary+Clinton\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70904\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70904\/hillary-clinton-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Hillary Clinton\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/hillary-clinton-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/hillary-clinton-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/hillary-clinton-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/hillary-clinton-time-100-feat.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/hillary-clinton-time-100-feat.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Larry Marano\u2014Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"Hillary Clinton TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70904,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70904%2Fhillary-clinton-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlY55","encoded_title":"Hillary+Clinton","twitter_text":"Hillary%20Clinton%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Hillary%20Clinton%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Hillary%20Clinton%0A%0AThe%20advocate%20for%20women%20leaders%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70904%2Fhillary-clinton-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70904\/hillary-clinton-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70710,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/hillary-clinton-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=209px%2C39px%2C170px%2C170px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"TITANS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/titans\/","slug":"titans"},"collection_byline":"Malala Yousafzai","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}}],"active":1},{"title":"PIONEERS","color":"#784794","id":70711,"hub_url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers","articles":[{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70898\/jason-collins-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlWtX","title":"Jason Collins","friendly_title":"Jason Collins","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Jason Collins","excerpt":"The NBA player who went first","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 18:04:11","updated":"2014-04-23 22:04:11","minute":"6:04 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>I met Jason Collins when we were freshmen at Stanford. Not surprisingly, the first thing I noticed was his height. The second thing I noticed was his kindness off the court &mdash; and his fierceness on it. Kindness to his friends, his family and fans. Fierceness in his drive to win. Jason has always been focused on others, on what&rsquo;s right for those he loves, and on helping those whose jersey is the same as his.<\/p>\n<p>When Jason called to talk about his forthcoming <em>Sports Illustrated<\/em> cover story, &ldquo;The Gay Athlete,&rdquo; I realized at some point that I wasn&rsquo;t surprised we were having the conversation we were. Not because I knew what we were going to talk about when I answered the phone. Rather, because it made eminent sense that it would be Jason becoming the first openly gay, still active pro athlete in a major U.S. sports league.<\/p>\n<p>Jason&rsquo;s kindness and fierceness alike derive from that word too often bandied about and too rarely true: <em>integrity<\/em>. Jason has always maintained he&rsquo;s first a basketball player. He is. But he&rsquo;s also a leader and an inspiration. For Michael Sam, Derrick Gordon and others whose names we may never know. And also for those of us lucky enough to be fans &mdash; or to call him our friend.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"4\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3496836800001-4\"

She was as down-to-earth as I was nervous, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised. After all, this Bud-drinking Yankees fan was equally at home rooting for her Bronx Bombers as cheering on her team of prosecutors at trial against al-Qaeda.<\/p>\n<p>Her sports allegiance is fitting, since Mary Jo is the Babe Ruth of lawyers. As the first female U.S. attorney in Manhattan, she battled fraud, bludgeoned the Mob and was onto Osama bin Laden well before everyone else recognized him as the face of evil. Now, as chair of the SEC, she has brought that same furious focus to policing the Street and rationalizing the markets.<\/p>\n<p>Mary Jo White is without a doubt one of the most influential lawyer-leaders of modern times. But hers is the kind of influence measured not only in cases won and clients defended but also in people inspired and characters formed. After her decades at the pinnacle of law practice, her progeny fill the country&rsquo;s legal firmament.

Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientific officer at biotech firm Advanced Cell Technology, working with a group of researchers at CHA University in South Korea, changed all that.<\/p>\n<p>His team inserted DNA from a donor cell into an egg stripped of its own genetic code, but the goal isn&rsquo;t to create mini-mes. Instead, the method could mean a new way to make stem cells, which could then be turned into new nerve, muscle or insulin-producing cells to treat or even cure diseases like Alzheimer&rsquo;s and diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>The breakthrough is sweet for Lanza, who spent years defending work on stem cells extracted from excess IVF embryos at a time when lawmakers and the White House banned federal funding for some studies. The controversies may continue, but thanks to Lanza the science will too.<\/p>\n<p><em>Park covers health and medicine for <\/em>TIME<em> and is the author of <\/em>The Stem Cell Hope<\/p>\n<aside

videocassette. &ldquo;You have got to see this,&rdquo; Kim said. It was the audition tape of a local TV reporter then named Megyn Kendall. She was a lawyer and new to the business, but her tape displayed as full a set of the qualities of a network correspondent as I had ever seen: great looks, strong voice, authoritative yet cheerful presence and obvious intelligence. In other words, limitless potential. But there was a problem: we had no openings, which was quickly pointed out to me when I enthused about her during a phone call with Fox News chair Roger Ailes and other executives. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; I asked Roger, &ldquo;just look at the tape.&rdquo; I suspected he would see what I had seen. He did, and an opening was created. From the start, Megyn gave us insightful Supreme Court coverage, and she was among the first to spot flaws in the false rape charges against the Duke lacrosse players. She was too good to last as a mere correspondent, and she didn&rsquo;t. The rest, as they say, is history.<\/p>\n<p><em>Hume is a senior political analyst for Fox News Channel<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Megyn%20Kelly%20%7C%20TIME&body=Megyn%20Kelly%0A%0AAn%20authoritative%20force%20in%20cable%20news%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70888%2Fmegyn-kelly-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70888%2Fmegyn-kelly-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlWuf&text=Megyn%20Kelly%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70888%2Fmegyn-kelly-2014-time-100%2F&title=Megyn+Kelly\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70888\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70888\/megyn-kelly-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Megyn Kelly\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/megyn-kelly-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/megyn-kelly-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/megyn-kelly-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/megyn-kelly-time-100-feat.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/megyn-kelly-time-100-feat.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Jesse Dittmar\u2014Redux","caption":"","alt":"Megyn Kelly TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70888,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70888%2Fmegyn-kelly-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlWuf","encoded_title":"Megyn+Kelly","twitter_text":"Megyn%20Kelly%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Megyn%20Kelly%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Megyn%20Kelly%0A%0AAn%20authoritative%20force%20in%20cable%20news%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70888%2Fmegyn-kelly-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70888\/megyn-kelly-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70711,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/megyn-kelly-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=232px%2C37px%2C171px%2C171px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"PIONEERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers"},"collection_byline":"Brit Hume","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70862\/arvind-kejriwal-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlYlD","title":"Arvind Kejriwal","friendly_title":"Arvind Kejriwal","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Arvind Kejriwal","excerpt":"A powerful outsider in Indian politics","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 18:00:07","updated":"2014-04-23 22:00:07","minute":"6:00 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Arvind Kejriwal is the antithesis of the modern-day Indian politician.

Or at least that&rsquo;s what happened according to the so-called inflationary theory. But is the theory right? If the results announced in March by a team headed by John Kovac of the Harvard-&shy;Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics hold up, we&rsquo;ll have the most convincing confirmation yet. Kovac&rsquo;s experiment involved observations of what&rsquo;s known as microwave background radiation, in search of ripples in space-time called gravitational waves, which inflationary theory predicts. Kovac and his team report detecting the ripples through an iconic swirling pattern in the microwave radiation, which may provide the smoking gun for the inflationary model. We theorists were bowled over. If the results are confirmed, they will join a handful of breakthroughs over the past century that have profoundly shaped our understanding of how the universe began.<\/p>\n<p><em>Greene is a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the author of numerous books<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=John%20Kovac%20%7C%20TIME&body=John%20Kovac%0A%0AThe%20big%20brain%20explaining%20the%20growing%20universe%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70868%2Fjohn-kovac-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70868%2Fjohn-kovac-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlYlJ&text=John%20Kovac%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70868%2Fjohn-kovac-2014-time-100%2F&title=John+Kovac\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70868\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70868\/john-kovac-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"John Kovac\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-john-m-kovac-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-john-m-kovac-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-john-m-kovac-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-john-m-kovac-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-john-m-kovac-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Illustration by Michael Hoeweler for TIME","caption":"","alt":"John Kovac TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70868,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70868%2Fjohn-kovac-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlYlJ","encoded_title":"John+Kovac","twitter_text":"John%20Kovac%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"John%20Kovac%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"John%20Kovac%0A%0AThe%20big%20brain%20explaining%20the%20growing%20universe%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70868%2Fjohn-kovac-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70868\/john-kovac-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70711,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/john-kovac-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=28px%2C0px%2C577px%2C577px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"PIONEERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers"},"collection_byline":"Brian Greene","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70896\/travis-kalanick-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlYlR","title":"Travis Kalanick","friendly_title":"Travis Kalanick","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Travis Kalanick","excerpt":"The driven CEO who invented a new kind of ride","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:59:06","updated":"2014-04-23 21:59:06","minute":"5:59 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>You don&rsquo;t realize how much you need something like Uber in your life until you start using it.

Until you start using Uber as a verb.<\/p>\n<p>At first glance, a smartphone app that hails a car for you doesn&rsquo;t seem that exciting. But when you try it, you witness its glory: the cars are nicer and cleaner than taxis yet less expensive than town cars or limos. Once it&rsquo;s requested, you can track your car in real time and can text or call with more specific directions.<\/p>\n<p>I remember times in the past when, after seeing a Broadway show, I&rsquo;d beeline for the theater exit and rush down to the corner to hail a taxi, only to be met by 15 other people doing the same &mdash; all scowling and flailing their arms into oncoming traffic. I now can just leisurely power up my phone, press one button, stay for the curtain call and hop into my waiting car without a worry.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, Uber is rad. Its co-founder, Travis Kalanick, is super rad. He&rsquo;s savvy and driven.

Jenji shows a passion for diversity by creating characters of all backgrounds who are three-dimensional, flawed and sometimes unpleasant, but always human.<br \/>\nBut then, what else could we expect from a force of nature?<\/p>\n<p><em>Rhimes is the creator and executive producer of <\/em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy<em> and <\/em>Scandal<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Jenji%20Kohan%20%7C%20TIME&body=Jenji%20Kohan%0A%0ACreator%20of%20unforgettable%20characters%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70867%2Fjenji-kohan-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70867%2Fjenji-kohan-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlWKB&text=Jenji%20Kohan%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70867%2Fjenji-kohan-2014-time-100%2F&title=Jenji+Kohan\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70867\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70867\/jenji-kohan-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Jenji Kohan\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jenji-kohan-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jenji-kohan-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jenji-kohan-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jenji-kohan-time-100-feat.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jenji-kohan-time-100-feat.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Andrew Macpherson\u2014Netflix","caption":"","alt":"Jenji Kohan TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70867,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70867%2Fjenji-kohan-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlWKB","encoded_title":"Jenji+Kohan","twitter_text":"Jenji%20Kohan%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Jenji%20Kohan%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Jenji%20Kohan%0A%0ACreator%20of%20unforgettable%20characters%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70867%2Fjenji-kohan-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70867\/jenji-kohan-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70711,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jenji-kohan-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=180px%2C20px%2C242px%2C242px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"PIONEERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers"},"collection_byline":"Shonda Rhimes","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70884\/lydia-ko-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlWKD","title":"Lydia Ko","friendly_title":"Lydia Ko","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Lydia Ko","excerpt":"She's leading golf\u2019s youth movement ","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 18:03:07","updated":"2014-04-23 22:03:07","minute":"6:03 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>When I first arrived on tour, several veterans were kind enough to share a few words of wisdom.

Stanford professor Anat Admati, whose book <em>The Bankers&rsquo; New Clothes<\/em>, which she co-wrote with Martin Hellwig, has become a call to arms for reformers globally, has done just that. Rather than focus on the details of stress tests or Dodd-Frank regulations, Admati has asked a simple, powerful question: Why do banks, even under new postcrisis rules, do business with 95% borrowed money when no other business would dream of it? Why are banks special? Her answer: They aren&rsquo;t, and financial reform needs to go much further to reflect that. &ldquo;Is this complicated, risky system the best we can have?&rdquo; she asks. Thanks to Admati, central bankers, global policymakers and economists are starting to wonder that too.<\/p>\n<p><em>Foroohar is an assistant managing editor and economic columnist at <\/em>TIME<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Anat%20Admati%20%7C%20TIME&body=Anat%20Admati%0A%0AThe%20economist%20who%20dared%20to%20say%20the%20bankers%20have%20no%20clothes%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70858%2Fanat-admati-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70858%2Fanat-admati-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlWKF&text=Anat%20Admati%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70858%2Fanat-admati-2014-time-100%2F&title=Anat+Admati\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70858\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70858\/anat-admati-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Anat Admati\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/anat-admati-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/anat-admati-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/anat-admati-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/anat-admati-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/anat-admati-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Joe Pugliese\u2014August","caption":"","alt":"Anat Admati TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70858,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70858%2Fanat-admati-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlWKF","encoded_title":"Anat+Admati","twitter_text":"Anat%20Admati%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Anat%20Admati%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Anat%20Admati%0A%0AThe%20economist%20who%20dared%20to%20say%20the%20bankers%20have%20no%20clothes%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70858%2Fanat-admati-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70858\/anat-admati-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70711,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/anat-admati-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=25px%2C0px%2C598px%2C598px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"PIONEERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers"},"collection_byline":"Rana Foroohar","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70890\/obadah-al-kaddri-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlWKI","title":"Obadah al-Kaddri","friendly_title":"Obadah al-Kaddri","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Obadah al-Kaddri","excerpt":"A truth teller on the Syrian airwaves","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 18:02:27","updated":"2014-04-23 22:02:27","minute":"6:02 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Moderates are under attack in Syria.

A professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, he identified genes that allow yeast to get by on fewer calories and extend their life span by about 30%. Nice for yeast &mdash; not for hungry humans.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Sinclair upped his game and pinned down a chemical known as NAD that actually reverses the aging process in cells. NAD levels tend to drop by as much as 50% as we get older; if we could restore what&rsquo;s lost, aging cells might behave as if they were younger. Immortality is out of reach, but living more years with a body that&rsquo;s robust enough to make the most of them is a real possibility.<\/p>\n<p><em>Agus is a professor of medicine and the author of<\/em> A Short Guide to a Long Life<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=David%20Sinclair%20%7C%20TIME&body=David%20Sinclair%0A%0AThe%20geneticist%20who%20is%20making%20age%20reversal%20real%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70863%2Fdavid-sinclair-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70863%2Fdavid-sinclair-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlX0Z&text=David%20Sinclair%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70863%2Fdavid-sinclair-2014-time-100%2F&title=David+Sinclair\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70863\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70863\/david-sinclair-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"David Sinclair\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-david-sinclair-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-david-sinclair-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-david-sinclair-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-david-sinclair-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/doctor-david-sinclair-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Rick Groleau and Jake Miller","caption":"","alt":"David Sinclair TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70863,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70863%2Fdavid-sinclair-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlX0Z","encoded_title":"David+Sinclair","twitter_text":"David%20Sinclair%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"David%20Sinclair%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"David%20Sinclair%0A%0AThe%20geneticist%20who%20is%20making%20age%20reversal%20real%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70863%2Fdavid-sinclair-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70863\/david-sinclair-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70711,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/david-sinclair-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=24px%2C6px%2C616px%2C616px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"PIONEERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers"},"collection_byline":"David Agus","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70882\/kathryn-sullivan-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlX15","title":"Kathryn Sullivan","friendly_title":"Kathryn Sullivan","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Kathryn Sullivan","excerpt":"The world's weatherwoman ","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 21:05:33","updated":"2014-04-24 01:05:33","minute":"9:05 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>There may be no better way to appreciate the earth than to leave it, to look back on the beauty and fragility of our planet from the vantage point of space. Only a tiny fraction of humanity gets that opportunity, so when someone does &mdash; and also happens to be one of the smartest people around when it comes to earth sciences &mdash; it&rsquo;s good to have her on our side, especially in challenging times. That&rsquo;s what makes us all lucky that Kathryn Sullivan was just confirmed as administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<\/p>\n<p>Kathy is not just an ivory-tower scientist. She was part of NASA&rsquo;s first class of female astronauts, selected in 1978, and went on to fly three shuttle missions. She is the first American woman to walk in space and served aboard the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. That role in helping humanity look outward has not prevented her from looking homeward. The planet is suffering increasingly severe upheavals, at least partly a result of climate change &mdash; droughts, floods, typhoons, tornadoes. I believe my good friend Kathy is the right person for the right job at the right time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"67536\"

world&rsquo;s poorest President for his modest lifestyle. He doesn&rsquo;t ride around in limousines, nor does he live in an opulent official residence. But that doesn&rsquo;t make him any less of a leader than his counterparts elsewhere. Last year, he signed a new law making Uruguay the first country in the world to legalize the production and sale of marijuana. It was an important step, a bid to tackle criminal trafficking and regulate the supply of the drug while at the same time set up a new mechanism to help fill government coffers. It is still early days for the new policy. But on President Mujica&rsquo;s watch, Uruguay has embarked on a bold and fascinating experiment that will be closely watched by supporters of legalization in other countries&mdash;including myself.<\/p>\n<p><em>McCain is a co-host of Pivot&rsquo;s <\/em>TakePart Live<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Jos%C3%A9%20Mujica%20%7C%20TIME&body=Jos%C3%A9%20Mujica%0A%0AThe%20revolutionary%20who%20legalized%20pot%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70869%2Fjose-mujica-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70869%2Fjose-mujica-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlYSA&text=Jos%C3%A9%20Mujica%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70869%2Fjose-mujica-2014-time-100%2F&title=Jos%C3%A9+Mujica\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70869\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70869\/jose-mujica-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Jos\u00e9 Mujica\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jose-mujica-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jose-mujica-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jose-mujica-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jose-mujica-time-100-feat.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jose-mujica-time-100-feat.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Mario Goldman\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"Jose Mujica TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70869,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70869%2Fjose-mujica-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlYSA","encoded_title":"Jos%C3%A9+Mujica","twitter_text":"Jos%C3%A9%20Mujica%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Jos%C3%A9%20Mujica%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Jos%C3%A9%20Mujica%0A%0AThe%20revolutionary%20who%20legalized%20pot%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70869%2Fjose-mujica-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70869\/jose-mujica-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70711,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jose-mujica-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=233px%2C28px%2C205px%2C205px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"PIONEERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/pioneers\/","slug":"pioneers"},"collection_byline":"Meghan McCain","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70864\/edward-snowden-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlX19","title":"Edward Snowden","friendly_title":"Edward Snowden","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Edward Snowden","excerpt":"The renegade in exile","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 18:02:00","updated":"2014-04-23 22:02:00","minute":"6:02 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Edward Snowden&rsquo;s story is one of choices.

Imam Omar Kobine Layama, president of the Central African Islamic Community; Dieudonn&eacute; Nzapalainga, the Archbishop of Bangui; and Nicolas Gu&eacute;r&eacute;koyame-Gbangou, president of the Evangelical Alliance of the Central African Republic, are religious leaders who actually do what their faith tells them to do. Sharing a meal with these three showed me again what can happen when faith leaders walk their talk. Their witness has come with significant personal costs. For example, Imam Layama and his family have lived with the Archbishop since December when it became too dangerous in Bangui to stay in the imam&rsquo;s house. Because of their efforts the world is taking notice of the conflict. The imam eloquently stated an important truth: &ldquo;Politics try to divide the religious in our country, but religion shouldn&rsquo;t be a cause of hate, war or strife.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Wallis is president and founder of Sojourners; his new book is<\/em> The (Un)Common Good: How the Gospel Brings Hope to a World Divided<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Imam%20Omar%20Kobine%20Layama%2C%20Archbishop%20Dieudonn%C3%A9%20Nzapalainga%20and%20The%20Rev.%20Nicolas%20Gu%C3%A9r%C3%A9koyame-Gbangou%20%7C%20TIME&body=Imam%20Omar%20Kobine%20Layama%2C%20Archbishop%20Dieudonn%C3%A9%20Nzapalainga%20and%20The%20Rev.%20Nicolas%20Gu%C3%A9r%C3%A9koyame-Gbangou%0A%0AFaith%20leaders%20on%20the%20front%20line%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70894%2Fnicolas-guerekoyame-gbangou-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70894%2Fnicolas-guerekoyame-gbangou-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlYSK&text=Rev.%20Gu%C3%A9r%C3%A9koyame-Gbangou%2C%20Imam%20Layama%20and%20Archbishop%20Nzapalainga%20are%20on%20the%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70894%2Fnicolas-guerekoyame-gbangou-2014-time-100%2F&title=Imam+Omar+Kobine+Layama%2C+Archbishop+Dieudonn%C3%A9+Nzapalainga+and+The+Rev.+Nicolas+Gu%C3%A9r%C3%A9koyame-Gbangou\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70894\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70894\/nicolas-guerekoyame-gbangou-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Imam Omar Kobine Layama, Archbishop Dieudonn\u00e9 Nzapalainga and The Rev.

In 1998, Arunachalam Muruganantham asked his wife why she hoarded dirty rags and was told she needed them during menstruation. Buying sanitary napkins would cost too much. His response: designing a simple machine to produce sanitary pads. He even wore some himself, using a tiny pump to test absorption.

very good actors. The encounters were brief, but I&rsquo;ve remembered them both with great admiration. Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton both embodied qualities which one is fogyishly tempted to look at with nostalgia. Along with very considerable talent, they had elegance, glamor, wit, kindness and decency.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t know at the time that they were married or that they had a son of about 10 who was quietly gestating all the same attributes. And now, 30 years later, the boy has been let loose. He has taken the form of Benedict Cumberbatch.<\/p>\n<p>His parents&rsquo; qualities are on rampant display. It&rsquo;s rare to the point of outlandish to find so many variables in one actor, including features which ought to be incompatible: vulnerability, a sense of danger, a clear intellect, honesty, courage &mdash; and a rather alarming energy. I take no pleasure in feeling humbled, but there&rsquo;s no getting around it.<\/p>\n<p>He must be stopped.<\/p>\n<p><em>Firth won an Academy Award for his portrayal of King George VI in <\/em>The

Meyers is the best listener on television. To see the proof, watch him every night on his new show, <em>Late Night With Seth Meyers<\/em>. His ability to connect his big-picture brain with his compassionate attention to detail makes him a great host and a loyal friend. He is a sharp performer and superior writer. But his biggest talent is the delight he takes in helping others look good. At <em>Saturday Night Live<\/em>, Seth spent 13 years making sure the comedy sausage was delivered on time. Sometimes it was delicious; other times it was tough. But he always knew what the show needed to make it edible. Often it needed him on Weekend Update, as a fake anchor delivering real news. <em>Late Night<\/em> needs him now, and we are lucky he has arrived. It&rsquo;s a brutal business, this late-night game.

we live. In her role as Olivia Pope, <em>Scandal<\/em>&rsquo;s unflappable political fixer, Kerry Washington has used her grace and vibrant magnetism to transcend age, race and gender, and to provide a new mainstream media lens through which to view modern womanhood and professional excellence.<\/p>\n<p>Setting aside the &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; melodrama necessary to sustain a fictional series so titled, Kerry has offered up a fresh new archetype for what it means to lead while combining courage and compassion, strength and vulnerability, passion, steely discipline and unfailing loyalty. It is a role that makes full use of her distinctive talent for drawing in audiences with such authenticity that we often forget she is acting.<\/p>\n<p>Kerry&rsquo;s work with the President&rsquo;s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities since 2009 is also a source of deep inspiration, using arts education to close achievement gaps and ignite passion among young people.<\/p>\n<p>In a world that too often tells little girls to choose between womanhood and success, between femininity and a seat at the head of the table, both onscreen and off Kerry Washington embodies the promise that lives in all our young people to shape their own destinies and succeed as &ldquo;gladiators&rdquo; for the causes in which they believe.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\"

But he lived in Kenya, a country that demonized homosexuality. And so for years he pretended to be what he was not. In December 2012, his friend &mdash; a fellow gay man who had also spent his life mired in pretense &mdash; got sick. Even as he lay dying, he could not tell his family that he was sick. His death broke Binyavanga&rsquo;s spirit.<\/p>\n<p>The best-known Kenyan writer of his generation, he felt an obligation to chip away at the shame that made people like his friend die in silence.<\/p>\n<p>By publicly and courageously declaring that he is a gay African, Binyavanga has demystified and humanized homosexuality and begun a necessary conversation that can no longer be about the &ldquo;faceless other.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Adichie is a Nigerian writer and winner of the Commonwealth Writers Prize<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\"

N.M., while we were shooting <em>Sunshine Cleaning<\/em>. One night I was driving us home from a Mexican restaurant. I had just told her I was a great driver. Then, as we were leaving, I put the car in drive &mdash; rather than reverse &mdash; and drove us into a tree. It was a tap, not a cataclysmic crash. But to Amy, stuff like that is heaven. She just burst out laughing. That&rsquo;s what I love most about Amy &mdash; she&rsquo;s silly and funny and dirty. And she&rsquo;s incredibly honest. She&rsquo;s self-admittedly terrible at small talk and hiding her feelings, which I really admire in an industry full of gush. She&rsquo;s also spooky-good at her job. There&rsquo;s a certain mystique about Amy that helps the audience go with her on this chameleon of a career, from <em>Enchanted<\/em> to <em>The Fighter<\/em> to <em>American Hustle<\/em>. And I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s discovered her full bag of tricks even yet.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"68546\"

I would go so far as to call him a prophet. No, not a prophet in a biblical sense. Don&rsquo;t freak out. More a prophet in a universal, all-things-connected sort of context. Some say that through his books, John gives a voice to teenagers. I humbly disagree. I think John hears the voices of teenagers. He acknowledges the intelligence and vulnerability that stem from those beautiful years when we are, for the first time, discovering the world and ourselves outside of our familial stories. But he doesn&rsquo;t just listen to young adults. He treats every human he meets as their own planet, rather than simply one of his moons. He sees people with curiosity, compassion, grace and excitement. And he&rsquo;s encouraging a huge community of followers to do the same.

On his first night of shooting (where the &ldquo;All right, all right, all right&rdquo; took flight), the entire production caught a groove and went to a new level. That&rsquo;s what Matthew does. He&rsquo;s the guy on the court who elevates the rest of the team. Look at <em>The Wolf of Wall Street<\/em>&mdash;that chest-thumping thing Leo DiCaprio&rsquo;s character runs with, that&rsquo;s a little thing Matthew actually does. There are stars that suck up all the energy in the room&mdash;Matthew maximizes the energy and shares it.<\/p>\n<p>Another line that grew out of his character in <em>Dazed<\/em> was &ldquo;Just keep livin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He was very specific about it not having a g.

movie stars have to breathe the same air we do. Yao Chen, one of China&rsquo;s most beloved rom-com darlings, could have just kept quiet about the disturbing by-products of her homeland&rsquo;s epic economic rise. But the 34-year-old took her thoughts online. Yao now outranks Twitter luminary Katy Perry with her more than 66 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese microblogging service. (Twitter is blocked by the Chinese government, which is spooked by social media it can&rsquo;t control.)<\/p>\n<p>She has opined on everything from the effect on her young child of China&rsquo;s poisoned environment &mdash; choking smog, foul water and a toxic food chain &mdash; to the brave stand of a Chinese newspaper battling state censors. Last year she even quoted Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: &ldquo;One word of truth shall outweigh the whole world.&rdquo; Or perhaps one gulp of China&rsquo;s polluted air.<\/p>\n<p><em>Beech is<\/em> TIME<em>&rsquo;s China bureau chief<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Yao%20Chen%20%7C%20TIME&body=Yao%20Chen%0A%0AA%20Chinese%20superstar%20with%20an%20activist%20streak%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70808%2Fyao-chen-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70808%2Fyao-chen-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm0tN&text=Yao%20Chen%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70808%2Fyao-chen-2014-time-100%2F&title=Yao+Chen\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70808\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70808\/yao-chen-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Yao Chen\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/chen-yao-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/chen-yao-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/chen-yao-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/chen-yao-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/chen-yao-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Jason Kempin\u2014Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"Chen Yao TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70808,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70808%2Fyao-chen-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm0tN","encoded_title":"Yao+Chen","twitter_text":"Yao%20Chen%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Yao%20Chen%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Yao%20Chen%0A%0AA%20Chinese%20superstar%20with%20an%20activist%20streak%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70808%2Fyao-chen-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70808\/yao-chen-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70712,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/chen-yao-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=42px%2C6px%2C535px%2C535px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"ARTISTS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/artists\/","slug":"artists"},"collection_byline":"Hannah Beech","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70780\/barbara-brown-taylor-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlZpN","title":"Barbara Brown Taylor","friendly_title":"Barbara Brown Taylor","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Barbara Brown Taylor","excerpt":"A centering voice in the wilderness","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:57:37","updated":"2014-04-23 21:57:37","minute":"5:57 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Few souls are as synched to the world&rsquo;s mysteries as Barbara Brown Taylor&rsquo;s. An acclaimed Episcopal preacher and best-selling author, Taylor lives quietly on her farm in northern Georgia, writing spiritual nonfiction that rivals the poetic power of C.S. Lewis and Frederick Buechner. Her latest book, <em>Learning to Walk in the Dark<\/em>, is her 13th, and in it she urges believers and nonbelievers alike to dive into the deepest shadows of their lives in order to confront their worst fears and to find strength for life&rsquo;s journey. In the process, she adds, their faith may deepen. &ldquo;If you are in the dark, it does not mean that you have failed and that you have taken some terrible misstep,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;For many years, I thought my questions and my doubt and my sense of God&rsquo;s absence were all signs of my lack of faith, but now I know this is the way the life of the spirit goes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Dias

So it&rsquo;s about time someone of Mary Barra&rsquo;s caliber and experience was appointed to the coveted position of General Motors CEO. I&rsquo;ve never had the privilege of meeting Barra, but although we are a number of decades apart, I&rsquo;ve read her background and it is much the same as mine. She grew up in a working-class family, as did I, and fell in love with cars at a very young age. She fell in love with a red Chevy Camaro convertible, and I fell in love with the Model A my dad bought.<\/p>\n<p>Only time (and the pundits) will judge Barra and the kind of job she&rsquo;ll do for GM, its board of directors, its employees, the dealers and, most important, the people who buy its cars. If she remains as forthcoming as I&rsquo;ve seen her on television with Congress, she will enjoy a long tenure at the helm.<\/p>\n<p><em>Iacocca is the former president of Ford and the former CEO of Chrysler<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Mary%20Barra%20%7C%20TIME&body=Mary%20Barra%0A%0AThe%20executive%20in%20the%20hot%20seat%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70843%2Fmary-barra-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70843%2Fmary-barra-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlZpP&text=Mary%20Barra%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70843%2Fmary-barra-2014-time-100%2F&title=Mary+Barra\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70843\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70843\/mary-barra-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Mary Barra\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","id":70843,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70843%2Fmary-barra-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlZpP","encoded_title":"Mary+Barra","twitter_text":"Mary%20Barra%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Mary%20Barra%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Mary%20Barra%0A%0AThe%20executive%20in%20the%20hot%20seat%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70843%2Fmary-barra-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70843\/mary-barra-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70713,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/mary-barra-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=27px%2C23px%2C567px%2C567px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"LEADERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/leaders\/","slug":"leaders"},"collection_byline":"Lee Iacocca","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true},"banner":"<div class=\"collection-banner\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/leaders1.png\"\/><\/div>","initial":1},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70840\/john-kerry-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm0tT","title":"John Kerry","friendly_title":"John Kerry","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"John Kerry","excerpt":"The relentless negotiator","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:45:08","updated":"2014-04-23 21:45:08","minute":"5:45 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Diplomacy is in John Kerry&rsquo;s blood.

And his work on climate change exemplifies these qualities. Addressing the dangers posed by global warming has long been a personal commitment for him. I know from experience just how hard this is.

We&rsquo;d been fighting our way through capitals around the world trying to get Cold War&ndash;era debts canceled for the poorest, most heavily indebted countries. During her first term as Finance Minister of Nigeria, Ngozi arrived at her desk to find a weighty $30 billion owed. With oil prices on the rise, she stopped having to plead with her creditors and bought a massive chunk of her own debt so she could cancel it herself. As if to make a point. She became a legend in that moment. Humor and joy spill out of her, which can belie the fact that she&rsquo;s got one of the toughest jobs on the planet &mdash; how to ensure that the tens of billions of dollars earned each year in oil receipts go into productive usage, like agriculture, infrastructure, health and education.

Rouhani was then President Mohammed Khatami&rsquo;s insightful, pragmatic National Security Adviser; he was keen to seek a political solution through direct dialogue with the U.S. On his watch, Iran suspended sensitive nuclear activities as a gesture of goodwill until negotiations were completed.

Rouhani and his President were unable to show tangible outcomes of their efforts; they lost the next elections to a hawkish team.<\/p>\n<p>It took the West a decade to realize that bare-knuckle competition for regional influence was not a viable strategy for dealing with Iran. The recent interim agreement, facilitated by Rouhani&rsquo;s low-key diplomacy, could have been reached 10 years ago. With mutual respect, confidence building and compromise, this step can be translated into a broad security and cooperation agreement, paving the way for a grand bargain with the West and a sea change in regional security and stability.

Largely written off in 2007 when he abruptly resigned because of debilitating illness after just 365 days in office, Abe fought his way back. He reclaimed voters&rsquo; confidence and went to work designing a bold set of strategies &mdash; now known as Abenomics &mdash; to jolt Japan out of its decades-long economic doldrums.<\/p>\n<p>Abe&rsquo;s policies were designed to defeat deflation, ignite consumer spending and restore economic dynamism, and after only 20 months, the Japanese people have reason to believe a lasting recovery is finally in sight.

His steady style exudes confidence while revealing little, capturing the attention of thought leaders worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>His existential crusade to promote the country&rsquo;s success in a hypercompetitive global marketplace is born of his formative experiences with a China in shambles. Xi is determined to break the sclerosis that threatens the ruling Communist Party&rsquo;s grip on power, but he is relying on the politics of intimidation to do so.<\/p>\n<p>While his preoccupation will be domestic harmony, the world will demand China&rsquo;s participation at the table of decisionmakers. During his decade in office, Xi will become the first truly global leader to represent a country that for centuries has struggled with cohesion and unity. There is no middle path going forward &mdash; it will either be a failed effort, which would be catastrophic for the region, or a reformed Middle Kingdom that will become America&rsquo;s greatest

conference marking the first 100 days of his second term. Things have been going downhill ever since. The President has had a rough year. His policies have been solid, especially overseas, but his execution has been sloppy to the point of disastrous. His decision not to intervene in yet another Middle East war &mdash; Syria &mdash; was prudent, but empty talk of &ldquo;red lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assad must go&rdquo; led Vladimir Putin, among others, to doubt Obama&rsquo;s toughness. At home, his legacy will depend on the success of Obamacare, and yet the historic incompetence of its launch nearly destroyed the program. But he&rsquo;s also right: we have seen only the first 66% of Obama&rsquo;s presidency. He still has plenty of time to recoup and thrive &#8230; if he can only manage to manage better.<\/p>\n<p><em>Klein is <\/em>TIME<em>&rsquo;s political columnist<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Barack%20Obama%20%7C%20TIME&body=Barack%20Obama%0A%0AThe%20U.S.%20president%27s%20demise%20may%20be%20exaggerated%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70836%2Fbarack-obama-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70836%2Fbarack-obama-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlZWF&text=Barack%20Obama%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70836%2Fbarack-obama-2014-time-100%2F&title=Barack+Obama\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70836\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70836\/barack-obama-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Barack Obama\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/president-barack-obama-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/president-barack-obama-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/president-barack-obama-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/president-barack-obama-time-100-feat.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/president-barack-obama-time-100-feat.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Brooks Kraft\u2014Corbis for TIME","caption":"The President speaks about the Affordable\nCare Act from the Rose Garden.","alt":"Barack Obama TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70836,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70836%2Fbarack-obama-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlZWF","encoded_title":"Barack+Obama","twitter_text":"Barack%20Obama%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Barack%20Obama%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Barack%20Obama%0A%0AThe%20U.S.%20president%27s%20demise%20may%20be%20exaggerated%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70836%2Fbarack-obama-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70836\/barack-obama-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70713,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/president-barack-obama-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=200px%2C0px%2C213px%2C213px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"LEADERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/leaders\/","slug":"leaders"},"collection_byline":"Joe Klein","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70856\/wilthelma-ortiz-walker-pettigrew-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlZWJ","title":"Withelma \u201cT\u201d Ortiz Walker Pettigrew","friendly_title":"Withelma \u201cT\u201d Ortiz Walker Pettigrew","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Withelma \u201cT\u201d Ortiz Walker Pettigrew","excerpt":"The modern abolitionist","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:49:22","updated":"2014-04-23 21:49:22","minute":"5:49 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Withelma &ldquo;T&rdquo;

That is surely the explanation for the breathtaking rise of Narendra Modi, who &mdash; if the opinion polls are accurate &mdash; is poised to become India&rsquo;s next Prime Minister, and thus the world leader chosen by the largest electorate on the planet. India is currently ruled by Manmohan Singh, a mild-mannered 81-year-old technocrat with no political power of his own and a passive leadership style. Reverse every one of those traits and you have Modi, the charismatic, intense, utterly decisive head of Gujarat, one of India&rsquo;s fastest-growing states. Most Indians believe that their country has lost its way as its growth rate has been almost halved while inflation has soared. Modi has a reputation for quick action, encouraging the private sector, and good governance. He also has a reputation for autocratic rule and a dark Hindu-nationalist streak. But those concerns are waning in a country desperate for change.<\/p>\n<p><em>Zakaria is the host of CNN&rsquo;s <\/em>Fareed Zakaria GPS<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Narendra%20Modi%20%7C%20TIME&body=Narendra%20Modi%0A%0AThe%20divisive%20politician%20poised%20to%20lead%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20democracy%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70845%2Fnarendra-modi-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70845%2Fnarendra-modi-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlZWM&text=Narendra%20Modi%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70845%2Fnarendra-modi-2014-time-100%2F&title=Narendra+Modi\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70845\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70845\/narendra-modi-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Narendra Modi\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/narendra-modi-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/narendra-modi-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/narendra-modi-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/narendra-modi-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/narendra-modi-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Prakash Singh\u2014AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"Narendra Modi TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70845,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70845%2Fnarendra-modi-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIlZWM","encoded_title":"Narendra+Modi","twitter_text":"Narendra%20Modi%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Narendra%20Modi%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Narendra%20Modi%0A%0AThe%20divisive%20politician%20poised%20to%20lead%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20democracy%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70845%2Fnarendra-modi-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70845\/narendra-modi-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70713,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/narendra-modi-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=53px%2C14px%2C548px%2C548px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"LEADERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/leaders\/","slug":"leaders"},"collection_byline":"Fareed Zakaria","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70837\/eric-holder-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIlZWP","title":"Eric Holder","friendly_title":"Eric Holder","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Eric Holder","excerpt":"The justice seeker","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:49:15","updated":"2014-04-23 21:49:15","minute":"5:49 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Most Americans do not realize all Eric Holder has done to protect their freedom.

Since the financial crisis of 2008 &ndash; 09, the 46-year-old Yorkshireman has emerged as a key figure in the debate about financial regulation, questioning the value that banks add to the economy and calling for a &ldquo;reformation&rdquo; in finance. He was one of the first regulators to acknowledge that government bailouts encourage financial institutions to take too many risks, and he said of the Occupy Wall Street protesters, with their criticisms of overpaid bankers, &ldquo;They are right.&rdquo; More recently, he has suggested that big asset-management firms, such as Fidelity and BlackRock, can pose systemic risks to the economy and need close monitoring. In the City of London and on Wall Street, many people don&rsquo;t agree with what Haldane says.

As hosts, we Germans were concerned about how we would be perceived &mdash; the dark shadow of history still loomed. We had assembled a young, hungry, decidedly &ldquo;un-German&rdquo; team. A team that historically was disciplined, organized and physical &mdash; which perfectly fit the image of our culture &mdash; became one that was free-flowing, creative and energetic. There were growing pains, and the criticism was harsh. She remained supportive, and Germans ultimately embraced the new approach. We as a nation were comfortable showing a pride not seen or felt in generations. Merkel had presided over a transformational moment. After the triumph of 2006 came 2007 and a financial crisis; once again she had to convince skeptical Germans that change was needed &mdash; to rescue Europe&rsquo;s economy.

Governor Jerry Brown has eliminated a $26 billion deficit, getting legislators to make painful cuts and persuading voters to increase their taxes. Last year California was a national leader, creating 320,000 private-sector jobs. Our unemployment rate dropped from 12.5% to 8%.<\/p>\n<p>How did that happen? Governor Brown preached restraint. His frugality comes in part from three years as a Jesuit seminarian. I recall his refusal, in 1975, to replace the old carpet he inherited from Governor Reagan. When it became threadbare, with a sizable hole, he still refused to repair it &mdash; believing if he lived modestly others might too and would save the state money.<\/p>\n<p>Always ahead of his time, he&rsquo;s focused on fighting climate change, improving poorly performing schools, building America&rsquo;s first high-speed rail and overhauling California&rsquo;s broken water system &mdash; supporting America&rsquo;s largest agricultural economy.<\/p>\n<p>No longer the new kid, he&rsquo;s now the adult in the room &mdash; the wise steward of our state&rsquo;s resources.<\/p>\n<p><em>Davis was governor of California from 1999 to 2003<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Jerry%20Brown%20%7C%20TIME&body=Jerry%20Brown%0A%0ACalifornia%27s%20turnaround%20artist%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70839%2Fjerry-brown-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70839%2Fjerry-brown-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm10N&text=Jerry%20Brown%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70839%2Fjerry-brown-2014-time-100%2F&title=Jerry+Brown\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70839\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70839\/jerry-brown-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Jerry Brown\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jerry-brown-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jerry-brown-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jerry-brown-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jerry-brown-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jerry-brown-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Steve Schofield\u2014Contour\/Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"Jerry Brown TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70839,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70839%2Fjerry-brown-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm10N","encoded_title":"Jerry+Brown","twitter_text":"Jerry%20Brown%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Jerry%20Brown%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Jerry%20Brown%0A%0ACalifornia%27s%20turnaround%20artist%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70839%2Fjerry-brown-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70839\/jerry-brown-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70713,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/jerry-brown-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=234px%2C30px%2C191px%2C191px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"LEADERS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/leaders\/","slug":"leaders"},"collection_byline":"Gray Davis","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70854\/thuli-madonsela-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm10R","title":"Thuli Madonsela","friendly_title":"Thuli Madonsela","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Thuli Madonsela","excerpt":"South Africa's fearless public advocate","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:49:59","updated":"2014-04-23 21:49:59","minute":"5:49 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Thuli Madonsela is an inspirational example of what African public officers need to be.

But no one in either party today brings the level of missionary zeal to the task that Rand Paul does. From Berkeley, Calif., to Detroit, my Kentucky colleague has been cheerfully clearing a path for Republican ideals in the unlikeliest precincts.

He&rsquo;s beating the bushes for anyone who prizes liberty, and he&rsquo;s forcing people to rethink the Republican Party. He&rsquo;s showing them we&rsquo;re as serious about the Bill of Rights today as we were in 1860, when another Kentucky Republican built our party&rsquo;s first great coalition.

All this in a country that many in the region trade with or depend on for cheap oil.

In the run-up to the general elections in June 2015, both those who support him and those who doubt him agree that his role in Turkish politics has recently been amplified.<\/p>\n<p>As Foreign Minister, Prime Minister and President, Gul has for many years been an ally of Turkey&rsquo;s dominant political figure, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but also his main rival. When the Gezi Park riots erupted last year in protest against a decision by Erdogan to build a shopping center in the park, Gul declared that peaceful assembly was a democratic right. After Twitter was blocked, he was among the millions of citizens who broke the ban. &ldquo;A complete shutdown of social-media platforms cannot be approved,&rdquo; he tweeted.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey&rsquo;s democrats have high expectations of Gul, some of which have been shadowed by his signing of controversial bills. Gul is now at an important crossroads. He can choose a calmer life or go back into active politics to push for the democratization that the country sorely needs today.<\/p>\n<p><em>Shafak is a Turkish novelist, columnist and

Photoshopped Funeral<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside>\n<p>After being mentored by one of history&rsquo;s more ruthless dictators, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un spent his first year in power kicking North Korea&rsquo;s tires. He put its citizens through a wringer of drills, parades, maneuvers and alerts. He also tested the region and the world with missile launches and, in early 2013, a nuclear detonation. But he seems to have moved on to the extravagance phase &mdash; partying on a pleasure island, adopting a wayward former NBA player &mdash; without perhaps dwelling enough on survival. The detention of an American tourist and the killing of his uncle Jang Song Thaek jeopardized much needed business contracts and foreign-currency streams. These actions also distanced China, a key ally, and bolstered South Korean President Park Geun-hye&rsquo;s hardening line with the North.<\/p>\n<p>Most important, Kim&rsquo;s disregard for a desperately poor citizenry raises the eternal North Korean question: How much suffering can human beings tolerate?

We lost 217 U.S. troops in three months alone. One of the key AQI leaders was a brutal battlefield commander, Ibrahim bin &lsquo;Awad bin Ibrahim al-Badri ar-Radawi al-Husseini as-Samara&lsquo;i, also known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Abu Du&lsquo;a. Despite intense military and intelligence efforts and at least one targeted air strike, Baghdadi eluded capture and for five more years led those who killed thousands of Iraqis and Americans. Since 2011, there has been a U.S.-funded $10 million bounty on his head. But the worldwide hunt did not prevent him from moving into Syria and last year taking command of the deadliest Islamist group there. The lesson of Baghdadi is that human guile can usually beat a high-tech solution. For decades to come, the U.S. and its partners will be hunting terrorists like Baghdadi. The key to killing or capturing them will be intelligence built from the ground up, not just strikes from the sky.<\/p>\n<p><em>Kearney, a retired Army lieutenant general, was commander of theater Special Operations forces in U.S. Central Command from March <\/em><em>2005 to June 2007<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Abu%20Du%E2%80%99a%20%5Ba.k.a.%20Abu%20Bakr%20al-Baghdadi%5D%20%7C%20TIME&body=Abu%20Du%E2%80%99a%20%5Ba.k.a.%20Abu%20Bakr%20al-Baghdadi%5D%0A%0AThe%20world%27s%20most%20dangerous%20man%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70832%2Fabu-dua-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70832%2Fabu-dua-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1hf&text=Abu%20Du%E2%80%99a%20%5Ba.k.a.%20Abu%20Bakr%20al-Baghdadi%5D%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70832%2Fabu-dua-2014-time-100%2F&title=Abu+Du%E2%80%99a+%5Ba.k.a.+Abu+Bakr+al-Baghdadi%5D\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70832\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70832\/abu-dua-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Abu Du\u2019a [a.k.a.

As we walked out of Graydon Carter&rsquo;s Monkey Bar, the woman came for the check. Bob patted his pants and sport jacket and said he didn&rsquo;t have his wallet.

It is brave women like her who speak up for the voiceless who will create lasting change.<\/p>\n<p><em>Mam is an antitrafficking activist and a co-founder of the Somaly Mam Foundation<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Erwiana%20Sulistyaningsih%20%7C%20TIME&body=Erwiana%20Sulistyaningsih%0A%0AThe%20migrant%20worker%20who%20fought%20back%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70820%2Ferwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70820%2Ferwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm38U&text=Erwiana%20Sulistyaningsih%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70820%2Ferwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100%2F&title=Erwiana+Sulistyaningsih\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70820\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70820\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Erwiana Sulistyaningsih\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Illustration by Michael Hoeweler for TIME","caption":"","alt":"Erwiana Sulistyaningsih TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70820,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70820%2Ferwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm38U","encoded_title":"Erwiana+Sulistyaningsih","twitter_text":"Erwiana%20Sulistyaningsih%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Erwiana%20Sulistyaningsih%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Erwiana%20Sulistyaningsih%0A%0AThe%20migrant%20worker%20who%20fought%20back%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70820%2Ferwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70820\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70715,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/erwiana-sulistyaningsih-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=61px%2C3px%2C513px%2C513px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"ICONS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/icons\/","slug":"icons"},"collection_byline":"Somaly Mam","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70826\/pope-francis-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm38Y","title":"Pope Francis","friendly_title":"Pope Francis","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Pope Francis","excerpt":"A moral leader in word and deed","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 21:03:34","updated":"2014-04-24 01:03:34","minute":"9:03 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Rare is the leader who makes us want to be better people. Pope Francis is such a leader.<\/p>\n<p>His Holiness has moved us with his message of inclusion, especially for the poor, the marginalized and the outcast. But it has been his deeds, his bearing, the gestures at once simple and profound &mdash; embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners &mdash; that have inspired us all.<\/p>\n<p>Pope Francis reminds us in ways that words alone cannot that no matter our station in life, we are bound by moral obligations to one another. His example challenges us to live out those obligations through work &mdash; to alleviate poverty, reduce inequality and promote peace; to feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, care for the sick and open new doors of opportunity and visions of possibility for everyone. His message of love and inclusion, his regard for &ldquo;the least of these,&rdquo; distills the essence of Jesus&rsquo; teachings and is a tonic for a cynical age. May we heed his humble example.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"72446\" data-size=\"small\"><\/div>\n<p><em>Obama is the 44th President of the U.S.<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Pope%20Francis%20%7C%20TIME&body=Pope%20Francis%0A%0AA%20moral%20leader%20in%20word%20and%20deed%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70826%2Fpope-francis-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70826%2Fpope-francis-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm38Y&text=Pope%20Francis%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70826%2Fpope-francis-2014-time-100%2F&title=Pope+Francis\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70826\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70826\/pope-francis-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Pope Francis\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/pope-francis-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/pope-francis-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/pope-francis-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/pope-francis-time-100-feat.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/pope-francis-time-100-feat.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Max Rossi\u2014Reuters","caption":"","alt":"Pope Francis TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70826,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70826%2Fpope-francis-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm38Y","encoded_title":"Pope+Francis","galleries":[{"id":72446,"slug":"time-100-pope-franics-most-surpising-photos","title":"The Most Surprising Photos of Pope Francis","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/72446\/time-100-pope-franics-most-surpising-photos\/","type":"normal","hidecount":false,"fullscreen":true,"counterfullscreen":true,"adfrequency":0,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F72446%2Ftime-100-pope-franics-most-surpising-photos%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1rfUOon","encoded_title":"The+Most+Surprising+Photos+of+Pope+Francis","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","email_title":"The%20Most%20Surprising%20Photos%20of%20Pope%20Francis","hasAds":true,"twitter_text":"Pope%20Francis%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","fb_text":"Pope%20Francis%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","email_body":"In%20his%20short%20time%20in%20the%20papacy%2C%20TIME%20100%20honoree%20Pope%20Francis%20has%20led%20by%20example%2C%20attending%20to%20the%20poor%2C%20embracing%20the%20sick%20and%20washing%20the%20feet%20of%20the%20less%20fortunate","size":"default","galleries":[{"id":3597703,"title":"The Best Pictures of the Week: Nov. 14 -

She could have easily made the Time 100 list for her tireless ability to work, but instead she wins this honor, and a Pulitzer Prize, for the finished product of her years of labor, this masterpiece of a novel.<\/p>\n<p><em>Patchett, a best-selling novelist and essayist, is the co-owner of Parnassus Books in Nashville<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Donna%20Tartt%20%7C%20TIME&body=Donna%20Tartt%0A%0AThe%20author%20whose%20characters%27%20lives%20change%20our%20own%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70819%2Fdonna-tartt-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70819%2Fdonna-tartt-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1ht&text=Donna%20Tartt%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70819%2Fdonna-tartt-2014-time-100%2F&title=Donna+Tartt\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70819\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70819\/donna-tartt-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Donna Tartt\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/donna-tartt-time-100-feat-copy.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/donna-tartt-time-100-feat-copy.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/donna-tartt-time-100-feat-copy.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/donna-tartt-time-100-feat-copy.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/donna-tartt-time-100-feat-copy.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Peter Hapak for TIME","caption":"","alt":"Donna Tartt Time 100","providers":[]},"id":70819,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70819%2Fdonna-tartt-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1ht","encoded_title":"Donna+Tartt","twitter_text":"Donna%20Tartt%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Donna%20Tartt%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Donna%20Tartt%0A%0AThe%20author%20whose%20characters%27%20lives%20change%20our%20own%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70819%2Fdonna-tartt-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70819\/donna-tartt-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70715,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/donna-tartt-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=217px%2C6px%2C226px%2C226px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"ICONS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/icons\/","slug":"icons"},"collection_byline":"Ann Patchett","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70812\/arundhati-roy-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm1hv","title":"Arundhati Roy","friendly_title":"Arundhati Roy","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Arundhati Roy","excerpt":"The novelist who is the conscience of India","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:51:48","updated":"2014-04-23 21:51:48","minute":"5:51 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>In early 1996, Arundhati Roy, then a screenwriter in Delhi, called me to say that she had written a novel. I can still remember my first enraptured reading of <em>The God of Small Things<\/em>. The novel seemed, in its evocations of the beauty and terror of life, its radical distrust of power, reflexive hatred of injustice and effervescent humor, almost miraculous. More remarkably, Roy&rsquo;s subsequent nonfictional engagement with the conflicts and traumas of a heedlessly globalized world has manifested the virtues of an unflinching emotional as well as political intelligence. Her lucid and probing essays offer sharp insights on a range of matters, from crony capitalism and environmental depredation to the perils of nationalism and, in her most recent work, the insidiousness of the Hindu caste system. In an age of intellectual logrolling and mass-manufactured infotainment, she continues to offer bracing ways of seeing, thinking and feeling.<\/p>\n<p><em>Mishra&rsquo;s latest book is <\/em>A Great Clamour: Encounters With China and Its Neighbours<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Arundhati%20Roy%20%7C%20TIME&body=Arundhati%20Roy%0A%0AThe%20novelist%20who%20is%20the%20conscience%20of%20India%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70812%2Farundhati-roy-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70812%2Farundhati-roy-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1hv&text=Arundhati%20Roy%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70812%2Farundhati-roy-2014-time-100%2F&title=Arundhati+Roy\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70812\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70812\/arundhati-roy-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Arundhati Roy\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/arundhati-roy-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/arundhati-roy-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/arundhati-roy-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/arundhati-roy-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/arundhati-roy-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"Chiara Goia","caption":"","alt":"Arundhati Roy TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70812,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70812%2Farundhati-roy-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1hv","encoded_title":"Arundhati+Roy","twitter_text":"Arundhati%20Roy%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Arundhati%20Roy%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Arundhati%20Roy%0A%0AThe%20novelist%20who%20is%20the%20conscience%20of%20India%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70812%2Farundhati-roy-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70812\/arundhati-roy-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70715,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/arundhati-roy-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=208px%2C24px%2C183px%2C183px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"ICONS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/icons\/","slug":"icons"},"collection_byline":"Pankaj Mishra","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70816\/christy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm1hx","title":"Christy Turlington Burns","friendly_title":"Christy Turlington Burns","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Christy Turlington Burns","excerpt":"An ambassador for maternal health","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:51:41","updated":"2014-04-23 21:51:41","minute":"5:51 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, &ldquo;There are no second acts in American lives.&rdquo; Christy Turlington Burns proves he was wrong. Christy&rsquo;s second act is her tenacious fight against maternal mortality. After the birth of her first child, she suffered postpartum hemorrhage. In the U.S., it&rsquo;s a common complication of labor, but it&rsquo;s almost always manageable. In developing countries, it can be deadly. Christy&rsquo;s realization that her life and her baby&rsquo;s turned on the luck of geography inspired her to take action.<\/p>\n<p>She made the documentary <em>No Woman, No Cry<\/em> to raise awareness of maternal mortality. Then she founded Every Mother Counts, which provides health education, medicine and emergency care in poor countries. Christy focuses like a laser on efficiency. Every Mother Counts promises that a $1 donation means $1 in the hands of the people saving lives. And the wind is at her back. Maternal mortality is down by almost half since 1990, a leading indicator of a better world, because mothers are the beating heart of communities. When they are healthy, everyone thrives. Christy is helping make that happen.<\/p>\n<p><em>Gates is a co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Christy%20Turlington%20Burns%20%7C%20TIME&body=Christy%20Turlington%20Burns%0A%0AAn%20ambassador%20for%20maternal%20health%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70816%2Fchristy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70816%2Fchristy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1hx&text=Christy%20Turlington%20Burns%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70816%2Fchristy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100%2F&title=Christy+Turlington+Burns\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70816\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70816\/christy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Christy Turlington Burns\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"portrait","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/christy-turlington-time-100-feat.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/christy-turlington-time-100-feat.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/christy-turlington-time-100-feat.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/christy-turlington-time-100-feat.jpg?w=407","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/christy-turlington-time-100-feat.jpg?w=814"},"credit":"John Estey","caption":"","alt":"Christy Turlington Burns TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70816,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70816%2Fchristy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm1hx","encoded_title":"Christy+Turlington+Burns","twitter_text":"Christy%20Turlington%20Burns%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Christy%20Turlington%20Burns%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Christy%20Turlington%20Burns%0A%0AAn%20ambassador%20for%20maternal%20health%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70816%2Fchristy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70816\/christy-turlington-burns-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70715,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/christy-turlington-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=228px%2C37px%2C184px%2C184px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"ICONS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/icons\/","slug":"icons"},"collection_byline":"Melinda Gates","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70814\/carrie-underwood-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm3pm","title":"Carrie Underwood","friendly_title":"Carrie Underwood","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Carrie Underwood","excerpt":"The all-round American idol","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 20:31:45","updated":"2014-04-24 00:31:45","minute":"8:31 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>I remember Carrie Underwood early on telling me how badly she wanted to earn her place in our industry.

Not only has she earned her place, she&rsquo;s also raised the bar: she&rsquo;s a prolific songwriter, a trendsetter and an Opry member. But it&rsquo;s her decency as a person that is so impressive. She&rsquo;s an advocate for causes like animal rights and the Red Cross. She has publicly challenged lawmakers when she&rsquo;s disagreed with them, and covered controversial issues in her music. She can sing the fire out of a song <em>and<\/em> tell a joke. I&rsquo;m always amazed at her comedic timing and instincts when we co-host the CMA Awards. She has faith, a sense of self and loves a good challenge. When most singers tackle a Broadway musical, it&rsquo;s in front of a thousand people.

If I had a daughter, nothing would make me happier than to hear her say she wanted to grow up to be like Carrie Underwood.<\/p>\n<p><em>Paisley is an award-winning singer-songwriter<\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Carrie%20Underwood%20%7C%20TIME&body=Carrie%20Underwood%0A%0AThe%20all-round%20American%20idol%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70814%2Fcarrie-underwood-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70814%2Fcarrie-underwood-2014-time-100%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm3pm&text=Carrie%20Underwood%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70814%2Fcarrie-underwood-2014-time-100%2F&title=Carrie+Underwood\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"70814\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/70814\/carrie-underwood-2014-time-100\/\" data-title=\"Carrie Underwood\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more"},"tags":"influencers|TIME 100","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/carrie-underwood-time-100-feat1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/carrie-underwood-time-100-feat1.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/carrie-underwood-time-100-feat1.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/carrie-underwood-time-100-feat1.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/carrie-underwood-time-100-feat1.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Kevin Winter\u2014Getty Images","caption":"","alt":"Carrie Underwood TIME 100","providers":[]},"id":70814,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70814%2Fcarrie-underwood-2014-time-100%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1nIm3pm","encoded_title":"Carrie+Underwood","twitter_text":"Carrie%20Underwood%20is%20on%20%40TIME%27s%20list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20most%20influential%20people%20%23TIME100","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","subjects":[null],"email_title":"Carrie%20Underwood%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"Carrie%20Underwood%0A%0AThe%20all-round%20American%20idol%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F70814%2Fcarrie-underwood-2014-time-100%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-related|rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70814\/carrie-underwood-2014-time-100\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"hub_id":70715,"left_rail_image":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/04\/carrie-underwood-time-100-2x.jpg?crop=230px%2C45px%2C184px%2C184px&resize=74%2C74","hub_meta":{"name":"ICONS","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/icons\/","slug":"icons"},"collection_byline":"Brad Paisley","collection_meta":{"name":"TIME 100","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/collection\/2014-time-100\/","ad_zone":"time100","franchise_value":"TIME100 2014","eyebrow_title":"TIME 100","show_collection_name":true,"show_hub_name":true}},{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/70824\/phoebe-philo-2014-time-100\/","shortlink":"http:\/\/ti.me\/1nIm3pq","title":"Phoebe Philo","friendly_title":"Phoebe Philo","post_type":"time_collection_post","available":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Phoebe Philo","excerpt":"C\u00e9line\u2019s fashion powerhouse","format":"article","time":{"pretty":"April 23, 2014","published":"2014-04-23 17:54:17","updated":"2014-04-23 21:54:17","minute":"5:54 pm","short":"4\/23","hide_date":false},"content":"<p>Phoebe and I met in 1994 at Central Saint Martins in London.

This is wrong. Alice Waters is a revolutionary who wants to change the world through food. In the &rsquo;70s, when she created her Berkeley, Calif., restaurant, American cuisine was considered an oxymoron. Alice set out to change that, persuading farmers, foragers and fishermen to raise fresh local food for Chez Panisse. That kick-started the farmers&rsquo;-market movement and proved that American produce could equal anyone&rsquo;s. Insisting that good food was a right, not a privilege, she then turned her focus to our children. Alice&rsquo;s belief that we should teach food in schools was once considered quixotic, but her Edible Schoolyard Project pioneered a national movement. Chez Panisse is undoubtedly the most influential restaurant of its time, but Alice&rsquo;s legacy extends far beyond that.

Eventually someone put the bullet in the gun, placed it in her hand and pointed it at her head. The violence of the audience was revealed. In<em> The Artist Is Present<\/em>, her seminal piece at MOMA, she revealed the sadness of the audience as she sat across from them for nearly three months and absorbed their pain. Marina most powerful is Marina most simple, Marina as Marina. I love the simple Marina, the powerful Marina, when the artist is present within her.<\/p>\n<p>I trust Marina to carve the artist out of her celebrity and use her celebrity to bring what she stands

He reminds me a bit of my late friend and Portuguese soccer legend Eus&eacute;bio. They have the same elegance and creativity. Back when I played, I would have loved having a teammate like Cristiano to play with up front. I would like to encourage him to keep up the hard work and to continue to fuel the passion for the sport among today&rsquo;s youth. Also, I wish him the best this summer at the World Cup in Brazil.
