	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Robin Morgan is an author, activist and feminist. She is also a co-founder, with Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda, of the Women's Media Center </h2>
    <p>I know, I know, TIME&rsquo;s annual <a href="http://time.com/3576870/worst-words-poll-2014/" target="_blank">word-banning poll</a> is meant as a joke, and this year&#8217;s inclusion of the word <em>feminist</em> wasn&#8217;t an attempt to end a movement. But as a writer &mdash; and feminist who naturally has no sense of humor &mdash; banning words feels, well, uncomfortable. The fault lies in the usage or overusage, not the word &mdash; even dumb or faddish words.</p>
<p><em>Feminist</em> is neither of those. Nevertheless, I once loathed it. In 1968, while organizing the first protest against the Miss America Pageant, I called myself a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s liberationist,&rdquo; because &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; seemed so 19th century: ladies scooting around in hoop skirts with ringlet curls cascading over their ears!</p>
<p>What an ignoramus I was. But school hadn&rsquo;t taught me who they really were, and the media hadn&rsquo;t either. We Americans forget or rewrite even our recent history, and accomplishments of any group not pale and male have tended to get downplayed or erased &mdash; one reason why <a href="http://content.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,1094264687001_2086963,00.html" target="_blank">Gloria Steinem</a>,<a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2088024,00.html" target="_blank"> Jane Fonda</a> and I founded <a href="http://www.womensmediacenter.com/" target="_blank">the Women&rsquo;s Media Center</a>: to make women visible and powerful in media.</p>
<p>No, it took assembling and researching my anthology <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sisterhood-Is-Powerful-Robin-Morgan/dp/0394705394" target="_blank"><em>Sisterhood Is Powerful</em></a> to teach me about the word <em>feminism</em>. I had no clue that feminists had been a major (or leading) presence in every social-justice movement in the U.S. time line: the revolutionary war, the campaigns to abolish slavery, debtors&rsquo; prisons and sweatshops; mobilizations for suffrage, prison reform, equal credit; fights to establish social security, unions, universal childhood education, halfway houses, free libraries; plus the environmentalism, antiwar and peace movements. And more. By 1970, I was a feminist.</p>
<p>Throughout that decade, feminism was targeted for ridicule. Here&rsquo;s how it plays: first they ignore you, then laugh at you, then prosecute you, then try to co-opt you, then &mdash; once you win &mdash; they claim they gave you your rights: after a century of women organizing, protesting, being jailed, going on hunger strikes and being brutally force-fed, &ldquo;they&rdquo; gave women the vote.</p>
<div class="video-wrapper" data-pos="1" data-continuous="1"><object id="bc-video-3781910450001-1" class="BrightcoveExperience"><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"><param name="width" value="100%"><param name="height" value="100%"><param name="playerID" value="1847503743001"><param name="isVid" value="true"><param name="isUI" value="true"><param name="dynamicStreaming" value="true"><param name="videoSmoothing" value="true"><param name="autoStart" value="false"><param name="linkBaseURL" value="http://wp.me/p5HMd-f3CC"><param name="includeAPI" value="true"><param name="templateLoadHandler" value="TIME_onTemplateLoad"><param name="templateReadyHandler" value="TIME_onTemplateReady"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="htmlFallback" value="true"><param name="@videoPlayer" value="3781910450001"></object></div>
<p>We outlasted being a joke only to find our adversaries had repositioned &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; as synonymous with &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; &mdash; therefore oooh, &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo; These days &mdash; given recent wins toward marriage equality and the end of &#8220;don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; in the military, not to mention the popularity of <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> &mdash; it&rsquo;s strange to recall how, in the &rsquo;70s, that connotation scared many heterosexual women away from claiming the word <em>feminist</em>. But at least it gave birth to a witty button of which I&rsquo;ve always been especially fond: &ldquo;How dare you assume I&rsquo;m straight?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet in the 1980s the word was still being avoided. You&rsquo;d hear maddening contradictions like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no feminist, but &#8230;&rdquo; after which feminist statements would pour from the speaker&rsquo;s mouth. Meanwhile, women&rsquo;s-rights activists of color preferred culturally organic versions: <em>womanist</em> among African Americans, <em>mujerista</em> among Latinas. I began using <em>feminisms</em> to more accurately depict and affirm such a richness of constituencies. Furthermore, those of us working in the global women&rsquo;s movement found it fitting to celebrate what I termed a &ldquo;multiplicity of feminisms.&rdquo;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3588846"></div>
<p>No matter the name, the movement kept growing. Along the way, the word absorbed the identity politics of the 1980s and &rsquo;90s, ergo cultural feminism, radical feminism, liberal/reform feminism, electoral feminism, academic feminism, ecofeminism, lesbian feminism, Marxist feminism, socialist feminism &mdash; and at times hybrids of the above.</p>
<p>Flash-forward to today when, despite predictions to the contrary, young women are furiously active online and off, and are adopting &ldquo;the <em>F</em> word&rdquo; with far greater ease and rapidity than previous feminists. Women of color have embraced the words <em>feminism</em> and <em>feminist</em> as their own, along with women all over the world, including Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>As we move into 2015, feminism is suddenly hot; celebrities want to identify with it. While such irony makes me smile wryly, I know we live in a celebrity culture and this brings more attention to issues like equal pay, full reproductive rights, and ending violence against women. I also know that sincere women (and men of conscience), celebs or not, will stay with the word and what it stands for. Others will just peel off when the next flavor of the month comes along.</p>
<p>Either way, the inexorable forward trajectory of this global movement persists, powered by women in Nepal&rsquo;s rice paddies fighting for literacy rights; women in Kenya&rsquo;s Green Belt Movement planting trees for microbusiness and the environment; Texas housewives in solidarity with immigrant women to bring and keep families together; and survivors speaking out about prostitution not being &ldquo;sex work&rdquo; or &ldquo;just another job,&rdquo; but a human-rights violation. From boardroom to Planned Parenthood clinic, this is feminism.</p>
<p>The dictionary definition is simple: &ldquo;the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.&rdquo; Anyone who can&rsquo;t support something that commonsensical and fair is part of a vanishing breed: well over half of all American women and more than 30% of American men approve of the word &mdash; the percentages running even higher in communities of color and internationally.</p>
<p>But I confess that for me feminism means something more profound. It means freeing a political force: the power, energy and intelligence of half the human species hitherto ignored or silenced. More than any other time in history, that force is needed to save this imperiled blue planet. Feminism, for me, is the politics of the 21st century.</p>

<p class="p3">Forget Forbes&rsquo;s 30-under-30 list: when it comes to &#8220;freshness,&#8221; 30 is the new 40. At her age, Taylor Swift isn&#8217;t even considered precociously successful&#8211; she&#8217;s just regular successful. In fact, it&#8217;s been a banner year for wunderkind, and not just in entertainment (which has always been fixated on the young and beautiful.) 18-year old Saira Blair just became the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/11/04/west-virginia-elects-americas-youngest-state-lawmaker/" target="_blank">youngest</a> American lawmaker when she was elected to the West Virginia Legislature. 18-year old fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson took up a second career&mdash;as a Broadway star&mdash;as her magazine <i>Rookie</i> rakes in <a href="http://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/read/interviews/2924/tavi-gevinson-the-pre-teen-sensation-turned-media-queen" target="_blank">3.5 million</a> hits a month. 17-year old Malala Yousafzai became the <a href="http://news.discovery.com/history/youngest-nobel-prize-winners-131011.htm" target="_blank">youngest </a>person ever to win the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p class="p3">As <a href="http://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/" target="_blank">most millennials</a> are moving sluggishly through their twenties, the hyper-visible hotshots are getting younger and younger, whittling away at the maximum age limit at which someone can get their &ldquo;big break.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">For every young cultural force like Lena Dunham or genius app-creator like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-ceo-evan-spiegel-buys-house-in-brentwood-2014-11?op=1" target="_blank">Evan Spiegel</a>, there are thousands of other twenty-somethings sitting in their parents&rsquo; basements wondering why they haven&rsquo;t invented an app or started a fashion line. According to a<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/" target="_blank"> Pew survey</a>, young people today have more debt and less income than their parents and grandparents did at their age, which means we&rsquo;re the least financially stable generation in recent memory. We&rsquo;re are making life decisions later than ever, delaying marriage and babies longer than previous generations did (partly because of the cash flow problems), and taking much longer to settle into a career. Yet, thanks to platforms like Youtube and Kickstarter that remove the traditional gatekeepers, there&rsquo;s a pervasive expectation that young people should be achieving more, faster, younger.</p>
<p class="p2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of attention paid to people who have success very young, like Taylor Swift and Mark Zuckerberg, but the average young person is not coming into their career until later these days,&rdquo; says Dr. Jean Twenge, author of<i> Generation Me. </i>&ldquo;Across the board, what you can see is much higher expectations among millennials compared to Boomers and Gen Xers, but a reality which is if anything more difficult than it was for those previous generations when they were young.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">Middle-aged sourpusses have long complained about America&rsquo;s cultural fixation on youth and to be fair, the Beatles weren&rsquo;t much older than Taylor Swift. Bill Maher even devoted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kWaKhrpa28" target="_blank">whole segment</a> of last Friday&#8217;s &#8220;Real Time&#8221; to ageism, calling it &#8220;the last acceptable prejudice in America.&#8221; But today, the world is dominated by tech, and tech is dominated by young people. &ldquo;I want to stress the importance of being young and technical,&#8221; Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/03/26/start-up-advice-for-entrepreneurs-from-y-combinator-startup-school/" target="_blank">said</a> in a speech to a Y Combinator startup at Stanford in 2007. &ldquo;Younger people are just smarter.&rdquo;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3580915"></div>
<p class="p5">But even for those of us who happen to be young, a youth-obsessed culture is a pretty raw deal. Because the perception that young people are &#8220;smarter&#8221; implies they should be getting successful more quickly, and often, they&#8217;re not. &ldquo;In the internet age, the idea that fame is just out of reach has become more common,&rdquo; says Dr. Twenge, noting that technological advances like YouTube helped launch careers of stars like Justin Bieber. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s an impression that it&rsquo;s easier to become famous now, or easier to be discovered&hellip; There&rsquo;s a perception that it&rsquo;s easier, but that may not be entirely true.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p5">That expectation that it&rsquo;s easy to get rich and famous may also contribute to some of the negative stereotypes about millennials, especially the reputation for laziness or entitlement. In other words, next to Lorde, the rest of us look like schlubs.</p>
<p class="p5">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re comparing themselves to those wunderkind necessarily, but maybe their elders are, who are so critical of them,&rdquo; says Dr. Jeffrey Arnett, who coined the phrase &ldquo;emerging adult&rdquo; and says he&rsquo;s found little evidence to support the claim that millennials are lazy. &ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s partly related to the fact that you have these amazingly successful young people, and people are saying &lsquo;well, if Mark Zuckerberg can do this, why can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p5">Of course, none of these comparisons are Taylor Swift&#8217;s fault, and she does everything in her power to nix that competitive instinct, especially among other women. But the fact that young superstars seem to have been born fully formed implies that growth and learning aren&rsquo;t part of the recipe for success. &ldquo;It not only tells them they don&rsquo;t have time to grow, it saps them of the motivation to grow,&rdquo; Dr. Dweck says.</p>
<p class="p2">Even Taylor recognizes that her darling days are numbered. &#8220;I just struggle to find a woman in music who hasn&rsquo;t been completely picked apart by the media, or scrutinized and criticized for aging, or criticized for fighting aging,&#8221; she<a href="http://time.com/3583129/power-of-taylor-swift-cover/?pcd=hp-magmod" target="_blank"> said.</a> &#8220;It just seems to be much more difficult to be a woman in music and to grow older.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p3">When politicians proclaim that &ldquo;young people are the future,&rdquo; they mean we&rsquo;ll inherit mountains of debt and a destroyed environment. But when young people think about our own futures, we should look at the way middle-aged and older people are treated&mdash;because like it or not, that&rsquo;s going to be us one day. If young people were really so smart, we wouldn&rsquo;t forget that.</p>

To put it simply, there are three types of people in this world: people who love the idea of dressing their infants in &#8220;leatherette skirts,&#8221; people who have no idea what a &#8220;leatherette skirt&#8221; is and people who fear a &#8220;leatherette skirt&#8221; will doom their innocent baby to a lifetime of sex tapes, 72 day marriages and questionable taste in floral print.</p>

You should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well. The madness has to stop. If the toys are damaging so is the clothing.&rdquo; Logan later withdrew the petition, saying that she had just wanted to start a conversation.</p>
<p>Considering that Babies R Us is a company that until recently felt totally <a href="http://time.com/3524685/breaking-bad-toys-r-us-walter-white/" target="_blank">comfortable selling action figures of meth dealers</a>, it&#8217;s unlikely it will pull Kardashian Kids. (In fact, the store recently said as much to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/03/petition-kardashian-kids-babies-r-us_n_6093964.html" target="_blank">The Huffington Post</a>.) But Logan&#8217;s concern&#8211;and that of the 2,941 moms who signed her petition&#8211;is just one more example of the shaming that&#8217;s been associated with Kim Kardashian&#8217;s name ever since she made her sex tape.</p>
<p>Many adults don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with two people filming their consensual &#8220;love making,&#8221; but ever since Kim&rsquo;s then-partner, Ray J, sold their x-rated tape to Vivid Entertainment, her public life&#8217;s been judged. For those of you who blocked out this harrowing time in early aughts pop culture, Kim filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment and eventually <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/55028/kardashian-gets-cash-closure-for-sex-tape">settled</a> for somewhere around $5 million. In other words, she turned exploit into profit, and made the first of many solid business decisions&#8211;including Kardashian Kids, which I&#8217;m guessing will do quite well considering the Kardashian reign of success.</p>
<p>The tabloid-reading denizens of middle America (myself included) have accepted most of Kim&#8217;s business pursuits as a natural by-product of her status as a sex star (<em>of course </em>she&#8217;d design lingerie&#8211;and more power to her.) But, her foray into children&#8217;s clothing crosses a line for parents like Amie Logan, who fear Kim has no place at the family dinner table&mdash;or, shall we say, changing table. &#8220;I would not choose to put my daughter in these clothes, and because the Kardashians are not people that have the family values that I uphold,&#8221; Logan&#8217;s petition now reads (having been updated since the initial post). &#8220;This whole petition, and the very negative responses I have received, has gotten larger than I ever expected when I started it last week. In the end it did get people discussing the issue&hellip;The original article seemed to leave out that this petition wasn&rsquo;t a crusade, but a means to get people discussing who should be raising their children, and what things retailers have the right to sell.&#8221;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3559185"></div>
<p>While I don&#8217;t want Kim Kardashian <em>raising</em> my children (though I would take Khloe as a sassy godmother and I wouldn&#8217;t mind an Hermes Birkin bag no matter whose drawing is on the front) I&#8217;m fine having my kids grow up with Kim and her sister-friends on the sidelines of their lives. With a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/kim-kardashian/">net worth </a>of $28 million, Kim has been at the center of a successful reality franchise, owns a chain of boutiques with her siblings, has lent her name to multiple clothing lines and even made a tanning lotion titled Kardashian Glamour Tan. Plus, let&#8217;s not forget the highly addictive waste of time that is the game <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em>, which could <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/maseenaziegler/2014/07/16/why-kim-kardashian-hollywood-is-a-200-million-hit-app/">earn</a> a predicted $200 million in 2014. In an industry that&#8217;s still dominated by men, shouldn&#8217;t Kim be celebrated as a successful businesswoman by us and our leatherette-wearing kids?</p>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3457862" data-size="default"></div>
<p>Feminism is more on trend than ever with stars like Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Miley Cyrus self-identifying with The F-Word. While there&#8217;s been some backlash against calling Kim Kardashian a feminist (Jezebel accurately <a href="http://jezebel.com/is-kim-kardashian-a-feminist-role-model-975647442">points out </a>that she represents impossible beauty standards that play into &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221;), there&#8217;s no denying that she&#8217;s a model of female success among a sea of male entrepreneurs. So, what exactly is the problem with our kids growing up with her name plastered on their clothing?</p>
<p>No child will be fated to a life of sex tapes and loose morals simply by wearing Kardashian Kids at the tender age of two. And, to be honest, most of the clothes look like something you&#8217;d find at Baby Gap (only designed by whoever makes Kanye West&#8217;s pants). Toddlers would probably go through life blissfully ignorant of their leatherette skirt&#8217;s sinister plans if it weren&#8217;t for their parents teaching them that there&#8217;s something innately wrong with clothing designed by a former sex tape star.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying that Kim Kardashian&#8217;s empire rests on a foundation of overt sexuality, but let&#8217;s admire the fact that she successfully built said empire on her own. Sure, some of Kim&#8217;s endorsements are less than inspired (Charmin Toilet Paper, for one), but she did what she had to do to succeed, and her business decisions are only getting more daring &ndash;&ndash; especially now that she&#8217;s a mom to burgeoning fashion icon North West. Just look at Kardashian Kids: instead of a bright pink palette, the line gives off a progressive, cutting-edge vibe with <a href="http://time.com/3263667/kim-kardashian-north-kanye-fashion/" target="_blank">gender-neutral tones</a> and the implied message that girls don&#8217;t have to be overtly &#8220;girly&#8221; to be feminine.</p>
<p>Kim once mused, &#8220;I have so much going on in my life. I never wanted anyone to think of me as Kim Kardashian, sex tape star.&#8221; There&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s hard to shake this notion, but fans and haters alike should learn to look past Kim&#8217;s tape and start applauding her for being both a successful momtrepreneur and a potential business role model for our children. No, I don&#8217;t want my daughter building an empire based on her looks, but I do want her building an empire as successful as Kim Kardashian&#8217;s.</p>

The competition for &ldquo;likes&rdquo; encourages creativity in young users, who can use filters and other devices to spruce up their images. And its simplicity &ndash; it&rsquo;s just pictures, right? &#8212; comforts parents haunted by the cyberbullying they hear about on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p class="p2">But Instagram&rsquo;s simplicity is also deceiving: look more closely, and you find the Rosetta Stone of girl angst: a way for tweens and teens to find out what their peers really think of them (<i>Was that comment about my dress a joke or did she mean it?</i>), who likes you (<i>Why wasn&rsquo;t I included in that picture?</i>), even how many people like them (if you post and get too few likes, you might feel &ldquo;Instashame,&rdquo; as one young woman calls it). They can obsess over their friendships, monitoring social ups and downs in extreme detail. They can strategically post at high traffic hours when they know peers are killing time between homework assignments. &ldquo;Likes,&rdquo; after all, feel like a public, tangible, reassuring statement of a girl&rsquo;s social status.</p>
<p class="p1">That&rsquo;s not what the app creators intended, of course, but it does make psychological sense: as they become preteens, research shows that girls&rsquo; confidence takes a nosedive. Instagram, then, is a new way for girls to chase the feeling of being liked that eludes so many of them. Instagram becomes an popularity meter and teens learn to manipulate the levers of success.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few of the ways that girls are leveraging Instagram to do much more than just share photos:</p>
<p class="p1"><b>To Know What Friends Really Think Of Them</b></p>
<p class="p2">In the spot where adults tag a photo&rsquo;s location, girls will barter &#8220;likes&#8221; in exchange for other things peers desperately want: a &ldquo;TBH&rdquo; (or &#8220;to be honest&#8221;). Translation? If you like a girl&#8217;s photo, she&#8217;ll leave you a TBH comment. For example: &#8220;TBH, ILYSM,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;To be honest I love you so much.&#8221; Or, the more ambivalent: &#8220;TBH, We don&#8217;t hang out that much.</p>
<p class="p1"><b> To Measure How Much a Friend Likes You</b></p>
<p class="p1">In this case, a girl may trade a &#8220;like&#8221; &#8212; meaning, a friend will like her photo &#8212; in exchange for another tidbit of honesty: a 1-10 rating, of how much she likes you, your best physical feature, and a numerical scale that answers the question of &#8220;are we friends?&#8221; and many others. Girls hope for a &#8220;BMS,&#8221; or break my scale, the ultimate show of affection.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>As a Public Barometer of Popularity</b></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram lets you tag your friends to announce that you&rsquo;ve posted a new photo of them. Girls do the app one better: they take photos of scenes where no person is present &ndash; say, a sunset &#8212; but still tag people they love and add gushing comments. It&rsquo;s a kind of social media mating call for BFFs. But girls also do it because the number of tags you get is a public sign of your popularity. &ldquo;How many photos you&rsquo;re tagged in is important,&rdquo; says Charlotte, 12. &ldquo;No one can see the actual number but you can sort of just tell because you keep seeing their name pop up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1"><b>To Show BFF PDA</b></p>
<p class="p1">That broken heart necklace you gave your bestie? It&rsquo;s gone the way of dial up. Now, girls use Instagram biographies &ndash; a few lines at the top of their page &#8212; to trumpet their inner circle. It&rsquo;s a thrill to be featured on the banner that any visitor to the page will see &#8212; but not unusual to get deleted after a fight or bad day, in plain, humiliating sight of all your friends.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3559340"></div>
<p class="p1"><b>A Way to Retaliate</b></p>
<p class="p1">Angry at someone? Don&rsquo;t tag the girl who is obviously in a picture, crop her out of it entirely, refuse to follow back the one who just tried to follow you, or simply post a photo a girl is not in. These are cryptic messages adults miss but which girls hear loud and clear. A girl may post an image of a party a friend wasn&rsquo;t invited to, an intimate sleepover or night out at a concert. She never even has to mention the absent girl&rsquo;s name. She knows the other girl saw it. That&rsquo;s the beauty of Instagram: it&rsquo;s the homework you know girls always do.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A Personal Branding Machine</b></p>
<p class="p1">Girls face increasing pressure not only to be smart and accomplished, but girly, sexy and social. In a 2011 survey, 74% of teen girls told the <a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/research/pdf/whosthatgirl_tipsforgirls.pdf"><span class="s1">Girl Scout Research Institute</span></a> that girls were living quasi-double lives online, where they intentionally downplayed their intelligence, kindness and good influence &ndash; and played up qualities like fun, funny and social. On Instagram, girls can project a persona they may not have time, or permission, to show off in the classroom: popular, social, sexy. Cultivating a certain look is so important that it&#8217;s common for girls to stage &#8216;photo shoots&#8217; with each other as photographers to produce shots that stand out visually. (Plus a joint photo shoot is more evidence of friendship.)</p>
<p class="p1"><b>A Place For Elaborate Birthday Collages</b></p>
<p class="p1">Remember coming to school on your big day, excited to see what you&rsquo;d find plastered to your locker? Now girls can see who&rsquo;s celebrating them hours before they get off the bus. Birthday collages on Instagram are elaborate public tributes, filled with inside jokes, short videos, and pictures of memories you may not have been a part of. &ldquo;There is definitely a &lsquo;I love you the most. I&#8217;ve loved you the longest edge to these birthday posts,&rdquo; one parent told me. Collages that document the intensity or length of a relationship are a chance to celebrate a friend &ndash; or prove just how close you are to the birthday girl. Although most girls know to expect something from their closest friends, not getting one is seen as a direct diss, a parent told me. And it can be competitive: another parent told me her daughter&rsquo;s friend stayed up until midnight just so she could be the first to post.</p>
<p class="p2">While girls may seem addicted to their online social lives, it&#8217;s not all bad &#8212; and they still prefer the company of an offline friend to any love they have to click for. (In a <a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/research/pdf/whosthatgirl_tipsforgirls.pdf"><span class="s3">survey</span></a> that would surely surprise some parents, 92% of teen girls said they would give up all of their social media friends if it meant keeping their best friend.) And, of course, likes aren&#8217;t everything. As 13 year-old Leah told me, &ldquo;Just because people don&rsquo;t write me a paragraph on Instagram doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;</p>

And good luck trying to stand between a child and their yearly candy harvest. It becomes a daily battle that almost always ends with someone near tears. (Usually me.) Is the only course of action left to eat all the candy myself?</p>
<p>I could always blame Jimmy Kimmel. The late night comedian staged his now-annual<a href="http://time.com/3556244/jimmy-kimmel-halloween-candy-prank/" target="_blank"> Halloween prank</a> where he has parents inform their children they ate all their Halloween candy and record the inevitable meltdown. The reactions are both funny and sad, but while some saw the prank as uproarious and others viewed it as a cruel hoax, I thought: Hey, that&#8217;s not a bad idea. If the candy just disappeared, the struggle would be over in one fell swoop. Off with the proverbial band-aid and on with the limited intake of sugar. But it&#8217;s kind of mean and the ensuing tantrum would not be fun to weather. As a parent, though, do I need to make <a href="http://time.com/109196/10-easy-ways-to-slash-sugar-from-your-diet/" target="_blank">the healthy choice</a> for my kid, whether he likes it or not?</p>
<p>In general, my kid can usually take or leave sugary <a href="http://time.com/3550948/lower-income-nutrition/" target="_blank">junk food</a>, but he spent a lot of energy collecting his plus-sized bag of Halloween treats and seems to view it as his own personal Candy Land version of Mt. Everest. Like a wizened mountaineer, he must surmount it, simply because it&#8217;s there. At this point, if the FDA had an RDA, or Recommended Dietary Allowances, of carnauba wax, I assure you, it&#8217;s been met as he determinedly makes his way over Mt. CandyCoatedChocolate. He doesn&#8217;t care about my equally large mountain of studies showing that while delicious, copious amounts of sugar are simply <a href="http://time.com/3556608/healthy-desserts/" target="_blank">not healthy</a>.</p>

<p>But what is a parent to do when it comes to squaring off against a bag-full of treats? Some parents are lucky enough to live near <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/10/31/dentists-halloween-candy/18251379/" target="_blank">wily dentists </a>who will buy Halloween candy for cold hard cash and deliver them to troops via Operation Gratitude. The more organized among us plan in advance with the brilliant Switch Witch gag where a &#8220;witch&#8221; steals the candy in the middle of the night and switches it out for toys. It&#8217;s a great ploy for those of with enough free time to pull it off. (Some of us would pay<a href="http://time.com/3549161/americans-would-pay-2700-for-an-extra-hour-a-day/" target="_blank"> $2,700 for an extra hour</a> in the day in which to plan a Switch Witch-style swap.)</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s something that my hippy mother struggled with when I was a child. Normally we were allowed no processed sweets&mdash;seriously, I got a box of sugary cereal from Santa each year, otherwise it was all health food store versions of Cheerios&mdash;so Halloween was a bonanza for us and a nightmare for my mother. Each year she had a new approach to the onslaught of sugar. One year we were allowed two pieces a day, which stretched the candy consumption until March and quickly became a supposedly fun-sized thing she would never do again. The next year we were told to eat all we wanted on Halloween and the rest would be done away with, the result being a now-infamous evening of candy-colored vomiting. After that, each year the candy trove seemed to be eaten by the dog, despite the fact that the stash was hidden on a tall shelf in the back of a closet and the dog was an overweight corgi with no vertical lift.</p>
<p>As a parent now, blaming the dog for a disappearing candy hoard doesn&#8217;t seem like a bad option at all, but I think I am going to attempt to strike a balance. I&#8217;ll let him have a few pieces a day for a few more days, while carefully supervising brushing and flossing and vegetable intake and side-eying a copy of the <a href="http://time.com/67532/how-to-quit-sugar-for-a-year/" target="_blank">Year of No Sugar</a>. After a week of daily candy intake, though, it might be time to take a page from my mother&#8217;s book and blame the dog when the stash disappears.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t have a dog, well, there&#8217;s always Jimmy Kimmel to blame.</p>

<p>The constitution bars Suu Kyi from becoming President in next year&rsquo;s elections because she was married to a British man and has two sons who are foreign citizens. It also guarantees 25% of legislative seats to military appointees. Since more than 75% of lawmakers are required to enact any constitutional change, this gives the generals a de facto parliamentary veto.</p>
<p>Talks aimed at amending these provisions, which were shamelessly included with the sole purpose of barring Suu Kyi from the nation&rsquo;s highest office, have gone nowhere, and the 69-year-old is attempting one last throw of the dice &mdash; appealing to Obama to put pressure on current President Thein Sein, himself a former junta general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Democratic reform would not be successful alone with the parliament,&rdquo; Suu Kyi told assembled media.</p>
<p>Nobody would argue against Burma&rsquo;s current constitution desperately needing revision, or pretend that reforms haven&#8217;t stalled. In fact, when Obama returns to Burma next week, he will find one of his few foreign policy successes in tatters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hope and the optimism we had in 2012, when the country was opening up, has all been squandered,&rdquo; Aung Zaw, managing editor of the <em>Irrawaddy </em>magazine, tells TIME, lamenting a &ldquo;backsliding reform process&rdquo; akin to watching &ldquo;a train wreck in slow motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so, Suu Kyi&rsquo;s condemnation is curious.</p>
<p>It comes after her steadfast refusal to criticize the military or the government for myriad human-rights abuses. In Burma&rsquo;s west, for example, more than 100,000 Rohingya Muslims languish in squalid displacement camps, but Suu Kyi <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/aung-san-suu-kyi-is-turning-a-blind-eye-to-human-rights-in-the-name-of-politics">repudiates</a> evidence-based <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/22/burma-end-ethnic-cleansing-rohingya-muslims">allegations</a> of ethnic cleansing by Human Rights Watch and instead <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/burmamyanmar/9430518/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-facing-backlash-for-silence-on-abuses.html">calls</a> the crisis an &ldquo;immigration issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In northernmost Kachin state, civilians face &ldquo;attacks against civilian populations, extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrest and detention, internal displacement, land confiscation, the recruitment of child soldiers, forced labor and portering.&rdquo; That&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-67_en.pdf">documented</a> by the U.N., but Suu Kyi has refused to condemn those atrocities. Her silence is so pointed that 23 local NGOs signed an open letter of <a href="http://www.burmanet.org/news/2012/09/27/kachin-news-group-open-letter-to-daw-aung-san-suu-kyi/">protest</a>.</p>
<p>Other causes of concern, like the 10 journalists <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28247691">jailed</a> this year on the flimsiest of pretenses, are brushed aside with platitudinous references to the &ldquo;rule of law.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Suu Kyi&rsquo;s own Rule of Law Parliamentary Committee has achieved &ldquo;nothing at all,&rdquo; says Aung Zaw.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3560353"></div>
<p>&ldquo;We would&rsquo;ve liked to have seen Aung San Suu Kyi speak on human-rights issues in a more forthright way,&rdquo; says Matthew Smith, executive director of the Fortify Rights advocacy group. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s issued equivocal statements on serious human-rights violations, in some cases amounting to crimes against humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, when a high-level delegation from Human Rights Watch came to Burma earlier this year for landmark talks, they met with senior government officials including the President but were snubbed by Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all. Suu Kyi&#8217;s baffling behavior goes beyond the area of human rights.</p>
<p>In April 2013, peaceful protesters blockaded a Chinese-owned copper mine near Monywa, around 450 miles north of Rangoon. The police <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21455087">attacked them</a> using white phosphorous, leaving dozens with horrific burns, including traditionally sacrosanct Buddhist monks.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi headed the investigation commission but found that the mine must continue operations or else risk &ldquo;hurting Burma,&rdquo; despite the fact that it is desecrating the environment, was set up without scrutiny by the junta, and provides no jobs for local people. In unprecedented scenes, the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader was <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/suu-kyi-meets-more-anger-over-myanmar-mine">harangued</a> by furious locals.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi has certainly experienced enormous personal sacrifice. Since returning to her homeland in 1988, she has spent 15 years under house arrest, not even being able to see her beloved husband Michael Aris before he died.</p>
<p>But this is also why her current aloofness is so painful to behold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NLD under her leadership has had big question marks,&#8221; says Aung Zaw, &#8220;and they misread the whole situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In August 2011, Suu Kyi met Thein Sein for the first time, formally marking her belated return to mainstream politics. The following April, she and 42 NLD colleagues were elected to parliament in a landslide amid jubilant scenes.</p>
<p>The common perception among analysts is that some deal was struck to allow Suu Kyi to stand for election in exchange for muting her criticism of the generals. The presumption was that reforms would take baby steps forward. But, three years on, there has been no progress, and she is partly culpable.</p>
<p>When Suu Kyi finally gave her Nobel acceptance speech in June 2012 &mdash; the prize having been originally bestowed in 1991 during a period of house arrest &mdash; she said that &ldquo;receiving the Nobel Peace Prize means personally extending my concerns for democracy and human rights beyond national borders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her present recalcitrance suggests that her own political career may be more important, even if we accept the mitigation that it is for some vague greater good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no version of pragmatism that would make silence on human-rights atrocities defensible,&rdquo; says Smith. &ldquo;These are some of the most serious human-rights violations that can be committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admittedly, Suu Kyi has always <a href="https://www.dvb.no/news/suu-kyi-i-started-as-a-politician-not-a-human-rights-defender/33976">said</a> she is a politician, rather than a human-rights defender. But the truth today is that she is pretty awful at both.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3560353"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

They were repeated, forty years later, in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/15/death-of-a-revolutionary?currentPage=all" target="_blank">the New Yorker&#8203;</a> by Susan Faludi&#8203;, who &#8203;described them as &#8220;one of the lines most frequently quoted by feminists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8203;If Lena Dunham&#8217;s latest lambasting is any indication, the words are still applicable today. The vitriol of the sisterhood is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/02/feminism-trashing-shulamith-firestone" target="_blank">alive</a> and <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/01/incomplete-guide-feminist-infighting/357509/" target="_blank">well</a>.</p>
<p>The latest controversy over Dunham goes like this: Last month, the 28-year-old creator of <a href="http://search.time.com/results.html?Ntt=girls+lena+dunham" target="_blank"><em>Girls</em></a> published a memoir, <a href="http://time.com/3425759/lena-dunham-a-generations-gutsy-ambitious-voice/" target="_blank"><em>Not That Kind of Girl</em></a>. In the book, much in the same way her HBO series does, Dunham takes on all sorts of taboos, in revealing, unfiltered, at times uncomfortable sections on virginity, sisterly intimacy and platonic bed sharing, date rape, and more. She is graphic in her sexual descriptions, including a passage where she describes, as a 7-year-old, looking inside her younger sister&#8217;s vagina (to discover that her sister had placed pebbles in it, presumably as a prank).</p>
<p>The scene is cringe-inducing. It&#8217;s uncomfortable, no doubt. It&#8217;s also funny. I &#8203;laughed, &#8203;turned the page and kept reading. Little kids do bizarre things.</p>
<p>I&#8203;t appeared that so did everybody else &#8212; until last week. That&rsquo;s when an article in the National Review &ndash; written by Kevin Williamson, a man notable for an article on how &ldquo;Laverne Cox Is Not a Woman&rdquo; and <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinNR/status/516218876066287616" target="_blank">seeming to suggest that women who get abortions should be hanged</a><b>-</b>- eviscerated Dunham for the chapter in her book about rape (he questioned why, if the story of an assault she suffered in college were truthful, she never &ldquo;<a href="http://time.com/3518282/lena-dunham-national-review-cover-rape/" target="_blank">felt the need to press charges, file a complaint, or otherwise document the encounter</a>.&rdquo;) The right&#8203;-wing website TruthRevolt then picked up the &#8203;thread, &#8203;homed in on the sisterly vagina scene &#8203;(along with a typo stating that Dunham was <em>seventeen</em> not 7) and declared in a headline (over which Dunham is now allegedly suing): &#8220;Lena Dunham describes sexually molesting her sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the version of things in my head, here&#8217;s how I would have expected this scenario to play out: &#8203;</p>
<p>A few right wing publications and gossip blogs would pick up the story. &#8203;The New York Post would write a &#8203;snarky headline. &#8203;Dunham would respond &#8203;on Twitter (<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/lena-dunham-responds-to-sex-abuse-claims">which she did</a>). Her sister, who is her best friend and tour manager, would chime in (<a href="http://time.com/3554403/lena-dunham-rage-spiral-media/">which she did</a>). Feminists would jump to her defense. What she did as a seven-year-old may bother people, but that&rsquo;s precisely Dunham&rsquo;s form of art. That doesn&rsquo;t make it abuse.</p>
<p>And yet&#8203;&#8230;&#8203; here is how it did play out. &#8203;Dunham was swiftly called a &#8220;predator without remorse&#8221; &#8212; mostly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DropDunham&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">by other feminists</a> on Twitter.&#8203; She was compared to R. Kelly, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/31/after-jian-ghomeshi-is-the-world-finally-starting-to-turn-against-bill-cosby/">Bill Cosby</a>, and Jian Ghomeshi. She became the subject of a hashtag, #DropDunham, which called on Planned Parenthood &ndash; which has joined Dunham on a number of stops on her book tour &ndash; to disassociate from her immediately.</p>
<p>&#8203;And on feminist listservs, Tumblr blogs and elsewhere, the pile-on began. She was &#8220;creepy.&#8221; &#8220;Not normal.&#8221; A &#8220;self-promoter.&#8221; &#8220;Full of herself.&#8221; A woman who needs to &#8220;sit the f&#8211;k down and learn something.&#8221; &#8203;She was told to &#8220;get some boundaries.&#8221; To &#8220;stop being weird.&#8221; Her story was, as one blogger <a href="theflounce.com/lena-dunham-white-feminism-cant-nice-things/" target="_blank">put it</a>, &#8220;best kept in the confines of your family kitchen over Thanksgiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was not the National Review talking. These were fellow feminists.</p>
<p>Yes, she had defenders: Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that suggesting &#8220;a 7 yr-old girl is even capable of &#8216;molestation&#8217; is vile&#8203;&#8221;; a sex researcher at the Kinsey Institute wrote that &#8220;it&#8217;s normal for kids to explore with each other;&#8221; prominent feminist voices like <a href="https://twitter.com/rgay/status/528692436009508864" target="_blank">Roxane Gay</a> (who called Dunham &#8220;gutsy&#8221; and &#8220;audacious&#8221; in a <a href="http://time.com/3425759/lena-dunham-a-generations-gutsy-ambitious-voice/" target="_blank">review </a>of her book), <a href="https://twitter.com/KathaPollitt/status/529679977936338944" target="_blank">Katha Pollitt</a> (who donated to Planned Parenthood in Dunham&#8217;s honor); and a group of women who launched a <a href="http://thosekindsofgirls.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> to curate all sorts of youthful (and at times unsettling) stories of sexual exploration. &#8203;(Dunham <a href="http://time.com/3556513/lena-dunham-sexual-abuse-controversy/">responded</a> again, too, writing in <a href="http://time.com/3556513/lena-dunham-sexual-abuse-controversy/" target="_blank">TIME</a> that she takes abuse seriously and noting that her sister had given permission for her to publish the story.)</p>
<p>And yet the vitriol from her critics was so intense, so personal, so almost gleeful, that it was hard not to wonder if this was really about Lena Dunham at all.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3556776"></div>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even seen this level of outrage over Bill Cosby,&#8221; one friend commented, referring to the <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/timeline-of-the-abuse-charges-against-cosby.html" target="_blank">allegations of sexual abuse</a> against Cosby.</p>
<p>Why, whenever there is a powerful woman speaking about feminism publicly (including, ahem: Sheryl Sandberg, and please see the disclosure in my bio) must they become so polarizing as to make feminism, as one journalist put it, &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/irin/status/529319048191180800" target="_blank">a bipartisan issue</a>&#8220;?&#8203; (It&#8217;s worth noting that among my cohort, anyway, there has been far more discussion about Dunham than about the <em>elections</em>).</p>
<p>Feminism is about giving women equal opportunity, equal voice, equal power. And yet, over and over again, when female voices attain that power, we &ndash; other women &ndash; parse and analyze their every move, public and personal, with an absurdly critical eye. We see it in politics, in pop culture, in film. From Hillary Clinton to Sandberg to <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/02/why-do-women-hate-hathaway-but-love-lawrence.html" target="_blank">Anne Hathaway</a>. (As Roxane Gay put it in a piece for <a href="http://therumpus.net/2013/02/how-a-wound-heals/" target="_blank">The Rumpus</a>, &ldquo;Young women in Hollywood cannot win, no matter what they do.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>To be clear: There are plenty of people who think Dunham&rsquo;s behavior toward her sister was questionable, and that&rsquo;s a valid argument to have. (Though &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; is a whole lot different from &ldquo;molestation&#8221; <a href="//www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham/" target="_blank">so say the experts</a>.) There are others who&rsquo;ve argued that acknowledging Dunham&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/04/will-white-feminists-finally-dump-lena-dunham.html" target="_blank">race, and privileged background</a>, are crucial to this conversation. (I happen to disagree &ndash; but that too, is a discussion worth having.)</p>
<p>But this has become a witch hunt &ndash; and it has everything to do with&#8203; how we view women <em>like</em> Dunham.</p>
<p>Feminism has a long history of what Ms. Magazine, in a 1976 piece by Jo Freeman, called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/trashing.htm" target="_blank">trashing</a>.&rdquo; That is, taking jabs at women who suddenly rise up, helping elevate them, but then tearing them down when they become too successful. &ldquo;This standard,&rdquo; Freeman wrote, &ldquo;is clothed in the rhetoric of revolution and feminism. But underneath are some very traditional ideas about women&rsquo;s proper roles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dunham is a perfect target for trashing &ndash; because she doesn&rsquo;t fit into our traditional molds. She is loud, out there, imperfect, messy, and some might say maybe even a little gross. She speaks openly about feminism, and sex, the ambiguity of consent, and she doesn&rsquo;t apologize for it. She makes people uncomfortable. And while she may have risen up propelled by the support of other women, somewhere along the way, she lost her likability &ndash; as powerful women often do. She is just a little too loud, a little too unapologetic, a little too overtly sexual, a little &hellip; successful.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make her a molester.</p>
<p>Dunham has always presented herself as flawed. She has never made herself a paragon, or claimed to represent us all. Yes, her character on <em>Girls</em> called herself a &ldquo;voice of her generation.&rdquo; She is also not her character (and has said repeatedly that it was just a line). And she&rsquo;s not a politician, she&rsquo;s an artist. It is her <em>job</em> is to push boundaries. To speak loudly. And, yes, to self-promote &ndash; and sell books.</p>
<p>Dunham&#8217;s accomplishments are what feminists should want women to aspire to: she is the writer, director and star, making art about women, from a woman&#8217;s point of view, in an industry that is still dominated by men. She doesn&#8217;t represent all women &#8212; and she shouldn&#8217;t have to. But she is willing to say what many other high-profile women won&rsquo;t (at least not publicly). Yes, she has a voice that creates controversy. Yes, she makes people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But why do we hold her to a seemingly higher standard? Why must her voice represent us all?</p>
<p>No one can be &#8220;everything to everybody,&#8221; Freeman wrote back in 1976. And neither can Lena Dunham. Like her, don&rsquo;t like her. Watch <em>Girls</em>, don&#8217;t watch it. But let&#8217;s not forget: There is room for more women than Lena Dunham at the top.</p>

It&#8217;s unwelcome because these calls aren&#8217;t support groups. Investors tune in to decide whether they should buy, sell or hold a company&#8217;s stock.</p>
<p>Take Google. On a recent <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2568635-google-goog-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?find=thrill&amp;all=false" target="_blank">earnings call</a>, Citigroup analyst Mark May asked a reasonable question about <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/" target="_blank">Compute Engine</a>, Google&#8217;s cloud services platform. &ldquo;What sort of impact is that having on revenue or expenses and capex for the business?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&#8217;re really thrilled by the momentum,&rdquo; Google CFO Patrick Pichette replied.</p>
<p>A no comment would have sufficed here. But Pichette offered less than a no-comment, a comment of negative value, a subjective emotion as answer to a mathematical question. It&#8217;s like ordering food at a restaurant and being served a picture of someone who just had a yummy meal. It neither nourishes nor satisfies.</p>
<p>And yet Pichette and Chief Business Officer Omid Kordestani went on to mention how thrilled they were about this or that (<i>we&#8217;re thrilled to be a platform!</i>) six more times during the call. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a thrill as &ldquo;an intense emotion or excitement&rdquo; that causes &ldquo;a subtle nervous tremor.&rdquo; The word comes from the English &ldquo;thirl,&rdquo; meaning to pierce something with a sharp instrument&ndash;to bore it, which is what Pichette and Kordestani were doing to their audience.</p>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3550055" data-size="default"></div>
<p>Nor were they the only corporate thrillseekers. &ldquo;Overall, I&rsquo;m <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2621475-groupons-grpn-ceo-eric-lefkofsky-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?find=thrill&amp;all=false" target="_blank">thrilled</a> with the progress we made across all of our initiatives,&rdquo; Groupon CEO Eric Lefkofsky said on Thursday. But at least Groupon&#8217;s stock rose 25% on the evidence of that progress. So even if Lefkofsky wasn&#8217;t exactly atremble with joy over the company&#8217;s progress, the surge in value Friday of his Groupon shares surely enlivened his mood.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3553806"></div>
<p>Not so for Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook&#8217;s shares fell 10% on warnings of slower growth and heavier spending. The normally low-key Zuckerberg had no thrills to report but he does get excited pretty easily&ndash;<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2607755-facebooks-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?find=thrill&amp;all=false" target="_blank">nine times</a> in last week&#8217;s earnings call. Most people in the Bay Area get excited when the Giants win the World Series, but for Zuckerberg it&#8217;s a new ad platform, deep linking or &ldquo;partnering with credit card companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is fine, in a nerdy way. But the point is, on Wall Street nobody cares about excitement levels, even with an influential executive like Zuckerberg. The numbers Facebook delivered meant everything in the selloff. The emotional state over at Hacker Way meant nothing. So why do executives even bother?</p>
<p>Sometimes the hyperbole defies common sense, as when Greg Blatt, chairman of IAC&#8217;s Match Group, which owns OKCupid and Tinder, explained that Tinder isn&#8217;t being monetized right now but that he &ldquo;<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2611655-iac-interactivecorp-iaci-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?all=true&amp;find=happier" target="_blank">couldn&#8217;t be happier.</a>&rdquo; But wouldn&#8217;t surging revenue and profits from the popular Tinder app make him happier? Because it would probably make investors in IAC feel better.</p>
<p>Perhaps the king of earnings hyperbole is Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook. Which seems strange because Cook gives off this constant Zen vibe. &ldquo;It&#8217;s just absolutely stunning,&rdquo; Cook said about Mac sales to a group of investors who were completely not stunned. Later, Cook added, &ldquo;I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one point in <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2576865-apples-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank">last week&#8217;s call</a>, Cook said he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be happier&#8221; about Apple&#8217;s ability to supply its new iPhone lines. Then, only a few seconds later, he said he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be happier with the way demand looks.&#8221; Which is either a direct contradiction or a crazy business koan that, once cracked, will yield immediate enlightenment.</p>
<p>The effect of such relentless hyperbole is that, when companies do have good news to be excited about, investors just dismiss it as more hollow rhetoric. Instead, it&#8217;s the immediate, often knee-jerk reaction to the stock price that sets the consensus on how well or poorly a company is performing financially. The thicker the happy feelings are layered on, the more they are distrusted as more corporate spin.</p>
<p>Of course, such grandiose language is also to be found outside of the tech industry. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Friday said he was &ldquo;<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2621935-starbucks-sbux-ceo-howard-schultz-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?all=true&amp;find=%22beyond+thrilled%22" target="_blank">beyond thrilled</a>&rdquo; to be announcing&mdash;not blowout profits or guidance surpassing Wall Street&#8217;s hopes&mdash;but a <a href="http://news.starbucks.com/news/starbucks-accelerates-growth-of-store-formats" target="_blank">new roastery</a> Starbucks is opening in December.</p>
<p>Maybe Schultz is on to something. Taking his words &ldquo;beyond thrilled&rdquo; at face value could be good advice for overexcited executives in general: Hurry up and get past your declarations thrills/excitements/pleasures. Because the rest of the market is already well beyond caring about them.</p>
<p>And while you&#8217;re at it, more numbers would be helpful.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3553806"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

<p>Ideally, you would have been reading this article three hours ago.</p>
<p>But it couldn&#8217;t even be written before now. There was a deadline. And another. And the dog wouldn&#8217;t stop coughing so there was a vet appointment to be squeezed in. There were Halloween treats to be rushed out the door. And a phone call with an editor. And an urgent text from a friend locked in a dressing room in desperate need of first-date fashion advice. Dinner should be started at some point. There&#8217;s a Halloween costume to mend (or, more realistically, duct tape on the inside so no one can tell) before tomorrow and another list of deadlines starts lighting up the iCal. Perhaps most indicative of the current state of affairs&mdash;a promising email titled &#8220;Need More Hours in the Day? These Calendar Apps Will Find Them&#8221; has been unopened in my inbox for three days. An article titled &#8220;<a href="http://time.com/43808/how-to-achieve-work-life-balance-in-5-steps/">How to Achieve Work-Life Balance in 5 Steps</a>&#8221; seems both inspirational and aspirational, based solely on the title, anyway as there has been no time to read the rest of it.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s too much to do in just 24 hours and it&#8217;s hard not to fantasize about adding hours to do the day. How much would you pay for an extra hour to work or sleep or read a book or, hey, finish the last season of <em>Orange is the New Black </em>(no spoilers!)? A new survey commissioned by Zico Coconut Water, says that more than half (58%) of Americans who were willing to pay cold hard cash in exchange for one more hour in their day, said they would be willing to fork over $2,725 to have that extra hour in their over-crowded day.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no small change you could find in the couch (if you had time to vacuum the couch, which is on the priority list right below brushing the dog&#8217;s teeth and above washing the curtains).</p>

<p>The fact that people are willing to shell out that kind of cash is, well, sad, but also indicative of a larger problem that is unfortunately hard to buy your way out of: An out-of-whack work-life balance. For most of us, the work-life balance is unbalanced as the sad kid at the playground who can&#8217;t find anyone to sit on the other side of the seesaw&mdash;you&#8217;re just sitting on the ground wondering when the fun starts. It&#8217;s like a unicorn who lives in the pages of Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s GOOP or those mystical beings living Oprah&#8217;s Best Life.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3549161"></div>
<p>According to the Zico survey, out of the 1,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+ surveyed, 74 % of them say they don&rsquo;t feel &#8220;completely balanced&#8221; and actively seek ways to counteract their busy schedules, hence with the whole take-my-child&#8217;s-college-savings-for-a-measly-extra- hour thing. Only 27% of those surveyed said they are &#8220;completely balanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a person who is solidly in the other 73%, one can only imagine these 27-percenters who tell a pollster that they are &#8220;completely balanced&#8221; must send their last work email precisely at 5:30pm, arise from their ergonomic chair to walk the eight flights down to their spotless car with nary a fast-food wrapper in site. They arrive home in time to cook a well-balanced meal of superfoods for their children who are eager to finish their homework before diving into a delicious plate that is up to the FDA&#8217;s latest nutritional standards. The kids brush their teeth in tiny circles for two minutes, floss and then head to their organic-sheeted beds to read their bedtime books in Japanese, their third language. They fall asleep immediately giving their parents plenty of time to watch the final episode of <em>Orange is the New</em> <em>Black</em> and get a full eight hours of sleep without once checking their work email.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;completely balanced&#8221; sounds like you&#8217;re living in a catalog, which is great but some of us don&#8217;t have time to peruse a catalog. Some of us are too busy meeting deadlines, mending costumes and searching the couch for change in hopes of buying an extra hour in the day.</p>
<p>Besides, haven&#8217;t you heard? There&#8217;s no such thing as a<a href="http://time.com/3510183/work-life-balance/" target="_blank"> work-life balance,</a> so do the best you can and save your money for <a href="http://time.com/49716/7-steps-to-start-taking-the-vacation-youre-entitled-to/" target="_blank">vacation</a>. Or, you know, vet bills.</p>

That is a shame, because it has overshadowed the substantive reality explored in the piece.</p>
<p>We know the vast majority of teachers are committed, caring and conscientious. They are not rotten; they are the core of our success stories in public schools.</p>
<p>The real issue is covered in the body of the story itself, and in the victorious Vergara case on which the Time piece is based: tenure, dismissal and seniority laws that work to keep grossly ineffective teachers in class. The most telling anecdote came from the superintendent whose singular request to improve his schools was not more public money or supplies but &ldquo;control over my workforce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why? Because states with flawed teacher laws are doing the unfathomable. They are working against their own stated mission of teaching <em>all</em> children well. In New York, the courts have found that access to at least a sound, basic education is guaranteed by the state constitution &ndash; and yet state laws actually undermine that.</p>
<p>It happens because tenure is granted to teachers long before school leaders have a reasonable chance to determine if those teachers are effective. It happens because dismissal laws make it nearly impossible for schools to fire teachers deemed grossly ineffective or even dangerous. It happens because teachers are laid off based solely on their level of seniority, without regard to their quality.</p>
<p>That fact that it happens in a minority of cases still amounts to hundreds or thousands of children in a large district. And if it happens at all and we know about it, is that not a problem we should fix? Otherwise, what is the message sent to students who are taught by teachers who brazenly fail to lead or control their class, let alone inspire their students? Sorry kids, better luck next year?</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3544600"></div>
<p>Parents are turning to the courts as a last resort, as a matter of inspiration out of desperation. Years of legislative inaction and inertia inside school systems have offered no other choice. If elected leaders will not lead, parents are justified to question whether these laws causing such problems are even constitutional.</p>
<p>The Time article mentions the New York case supported by my organization, but unfortunately describes the litigation in shorthand, calling it my lawsuit. It is not. I use my platform as a former TV journalist to draw attention to the cause. But the case belongs to the families who serve as plaintiffs, and they do not do it casually. It is not easy to take on the state government and the teachers&rsquo; unions.</p>
<p>These parents are fighting because they want more good teachers in our schools. Turns out that, they, too, are trying to fix this. And they deserve our support.</p>

But as a writer &mdash; and feminist who naturally has no sense of humor &mdash; banning words feels, well, uncomfortable. The fault lies in the usage or overusage, not the word &mdash; even dumb or faddish words.<\/p>\n<p><em>Feminist<\/em> is neither of those. Nevertheless, I once loathed it. In 1968, while organizing the first protest against the Miss America Pageant, I called myself a &ldquo;women&rsquo;s liberationist,&rdquo; because &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; seemed so 19th century: ladies scooting around in hoop skirts with ringlet curls cascading over their ears!<\/p>\n<p>What an ignoramus I was. But school hadn&rsquo;t taught me who they really were, and the media hadn&rsquo;t either. We Americans forget or rewrite even our recent history, and accomplishments of any group not pale and male have tended to get downplayed or erased &mdash; one reason why <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/video\/player\/0,32068,1094264687001_2086963,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gloria Steinem<\/a>,<a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/magazine\/article\/0,9171,2088024,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Jane Fonda<\/a> and I founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.womensmediacenter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Women&rsquo;s Media Center<\/a>: to make women visible and powerful in media.<\/p>\n<p>No, it took assembling and researching my anthology <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sisterhood-Is-Powerful-Robin-Morgan\/dp\/0394705394\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sisterhood Is Powerful<\/em><\/a> to teach me about the word <em>feminism<\/em>. I had no clue that feminists had been a major (or leading) presence in every social-justice movement in the U.S. time line: the revolutionary war, the campaigns to abolish slavery, debtors&rsquo; prisons and sweatshops; mobilizations for suffrage, prison reform, equal credit; fights to establish social security, unions, universal childhood education, halfway houses, free libraries; plus the environmentalism, antiwar and peace movements. And more. By 1970, I was a feminist.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout that decade, feminism was targeted for ridicule. Here&rsquo;s how it plays: first they ignore you, then laugh at you, then prosecute you, then try to co-opt you, then &mdash; once you win &mdash; they claim they gave you your rights: after a century of women organizing, protesting, being jailed, going on hunger strikes and being brutally force-fed, &ldquo;they&rdquo; gave women the vote.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"3\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3781910450001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f3CC\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3781910450001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>We outlasted being a joke only to find our adversaries had repositioned &ldquo;feminist&rdquo; as synonymous with &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; &mdash; therefore oooh, &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo; These days &mdash; given recent wins toward marriage equality and the end of &#8220;don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; in the military, not to mention the popularity of <em>Orange Is the New Black<\/em> &mdash; it&rsquo;s strange to recall how, in the &rsquo;70s, that connotation scared many heterosexual women away from claiming the word <em>feminist<\/em>. But at least it gave birth to a witty button of which I&rsquo;ve always been especially fond: &ldquo;How dare you assume I&rsquo;m straight?!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Yet in the 1980s the word was still being avoided. You&rsquo;d hear maddening contradictions like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no feminist, but &#8230;&rdquo; after which feminist statements would pour from the speaker&rsquo;s mouth. Meanwhile, women&rsquo;s-rights activists of color preferred culturally organic versions: <em>womanist<\/em> among African Americans, <em>mujerista<\/em> among Latinas. I began using <em>feminisms<\/em> to more accurately depict and affirm such a richness of constituencies. Furthermore, those of us working in the global women&rsquo;s movement found it fitting to celebrate what I termed a &ldquo;multiplicity of feminisms.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3588846\"><\/div>\n<p>No matter the name, the movement kept growing. Along the way, the word absorbed the identity politics of the 1980s and &rsquo;90s, ergo cultural feminism, radical feminism, liberal\/reform feminism, electoral feminism, academic feminism, ecofeminism, lesbian feminism, Marxist feminism, socialist feminism &mdash; and at times hybrids of the above.<\/p>\n<p>Flash-forward to today when, despite predictions to the contrary, young women are furiously active online and off, and are adopting &ldquo;the <em>F<\/em> word&rdquo; with far greater ease and rapidity than previous feminists. Women of color have embraced the words <em>feminism<\/em> and <em>feminist<\/em> as their own, along with women all over the world, including Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.<\/p>\n<p>As we move into 2015, feminism is suddenly hot; celebrities want to identify with it. While such irony makes me smile wryly, I know we live in a celebrity culture and this brings more attention to issues like equal pay, full reproductive rights, and ending violence against women. I also know that sincere women (and men of conscience), celebs or not, will stay with the word and what it stands for. Others will just peel off when the next flavor of the month comes along.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, the inexorable forward trajectory of this global movement persists, powered by women in Nepal&rsquo;s rice paddies fighting for literacy rights; women in Kenya&rsquo;s Green Belt Movement planting trees for microbusiness and the environment; Texas housewives in solidarity with immigrant women to bring and keep families together; and survivors speaking out about prostitution not being &ldquo;sex work&rdquo; or &ldquo;just another job,&rdquo; but a human-rights violation. From boardroom to Planned Parenthood clinic, this is feminism.<\/p>\n<p>The dictionary definition is simple: &ldquo;the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.&rdquo; Anyone who can&rsquo;t support something that commonsensical and fair is part of a vanishing breed: well over half of all American women and more than 30% of American men approve of the word &mdash; the percentages running even higher in communities of color and internationally.<\/p>\n<p>But I confess that for me feminism means something more profound. It means freeing a political force: the power, energy and intelligence of half the human species hitherto ignored or silenced.

At her age, Taylor Swift isn&#8217;t even considered precociously successful&#8211; she&#8217;s just regular successful. In fact, it&#8217;s been a banner year for wunderkind, and not just in entertainment (which has always been fixated on the young and beautiful.) 18-year old Saira Blair just became the <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/washwire\/2014\/11\/04\/west-virginia-elects-americas-youngest-state-lawmaker\/\" target=\"_blank\">youngest<\/a> American lawmaker when she was elected to the West Virginia Legislature. 18-year old fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson took up a second career&mdash;as a Broadway star&mdash;as her magazine <i>Rookie<\/i> rakes in <a href=\"http:\/\/i-d.vice.com\/en_gb\/read\/interviews\/2924\/tavi-gevinson-the-pre-teen-sensation-turned-media-queen\" target=\"_blank\">3.5 million<\/a> hits a month. 17-year old Malala Yousafzai became the <a href=\"http:\/\/news.discovery.com\/history\/youngest-nobel-prize-winners-131011.htm\" target=\"_blank\">youngest <\/a>person ever to win the Nobel Prize.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/247\/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation\/\" target=\"_blank\">most millennials<\/a> are moving sluggishly through their twenties, the hyper-visible hotshots are getting younger and younger, whittling away at the maximum age limit at which someone can get their &ldquo;big break.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For every young cultural force like Lena Dunham or genius app-creator like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/snapchat-ceo-evan-spiegel-buys-house-in-brentwood-2014-11?op=1\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Spiegel<\/a>, there are thousands of other twenty-somethings sitting in their parents&rsquo; basements wondering why they haven&rsquo;t invented an app or started a fashion line. According to a<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2014\/03\/07\/millennials-in-adulthood\/\" target=\"_blank\"> Pew survey<\/a>, young people today have more debt and less income than their parents and grandparents did at their age, which means we&rsquo;re the least financially stable generation in recent memory. We&rsquo;re are making life decisions later than ever, delaying marriage and babies longer than previous generations did (partly because of the cash flow problems), and taking much longer to settle into a career. Yet, thanks to platforms like Youtube and Kickstarter that remove the traditional gatekeepers, there&rsquo;s a pervasive expectation that young people should be achieving more, faster, younger.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of attention paid to people who have success very young, like Taylor Swift and Mark Zuckerberg, but the average young person is not coming into their career until later these days,&rdquo; says Dr. Jean Twenge, author of<i> Generation Me. <\/i>&ldquo;Across the board, what you can see is much higher expectations among millennials compared to Boomers and Gen Xers, but a reality which is if anything more difficult than it was for those previous generations when they were young.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Middle-aged sourpusses have long complained about America&rsquo;s cultural fixation on youth and to be fair, the Beatles weren&rsquo;t much older than Taylor Swift. Bill Maher even devoted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0kWaKhrpa28\" target=\"_blank\">whole segment<\/a> of last Friday&#8217;s &#8220;Real Time&#8221; to ageism, calling it &#8220;the last acceptable prejudice in America.&#8221; But today, the world is dominated by tech, and tech is dominated by young people. &ldquo;I want to stress the importance of being young and technical,&#8221; Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2007\/03\/26\/start-up-advice-for-entrepreneurs-from-y-combinator-startup-school\/\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> in a speech to a Y Combinator startup at Stanford in 2007. &ldquo;Younger people are just smarter.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3580915\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p5\">But even for those of us who happen to be young, a youth-obsessed culture is a pretty raw deal. Because the perception that young people are &#8220;smarter&#8221; implies they should be getting successful more quickly, and often, they&#8217;re not. &ldquo;In the internet age, the idea that fame is just out of reach has become more common,&rdquo; says Dr. Twenge, noting that technological advances like YouTube helped launch careers of stars like Justin Bieber. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s an impression that it&rsquo;s easier to become famous now, or easier to be discovered&hellip; There&rsquo;s a perception that it&rsquo;s easier, but that may not be entirely true.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\">That expectation that it&rsquo;s easy to get rich and famous may also contribute to some of the negative stereotypes about millennials, especially the reputation for laziness or entitlement. In other words, next to Lorde, the rest of us look like schlubs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re comparing themselves to those wunderkind necessarily, but maybe their elders are, who are so critical of them,&rdquo; says Dr. Jeffrey Arnett, who coined the phrase &ldquo;emerging adult&rdquo; and says he&rsquo;s found little evidence to support the claim that millennials are lazy. &ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s partly related to the fact that you have these amazingly successful young people, and people are saying &lsquo;well, if Mark Zuckerberg can do this, why can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\">Of course, none of these comparisons are Taylor Swift&#8217;s fault, and she does everything in her power to nix that competitive instinct, especially among other women. But the fact that young superstars seem to have been born fully formed implies that growth and learning aren&rsquo;t part of the recipe for success. &ldquo;It not only tells them they don&rsquo;t have time to grow, it saps them of the motivation to grow,&rdquo; Dr. Dweck says.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Even Taylor recognizes that her darling days are numbered. &#8220;I just struggle to find a woman in music who hasn&rsquo;t been completely picked apart by the media, or scrutinized and criticized for aging, or criticized for fighting aging,&#8221; she<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583129\/power-of-taylor-swift-cover\/?pcd=hp-magmod\" target=\"_blank\"> said.<\/a> &#8220;It just seems to be much more difficult to be a woman in music and to grow older.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">When politicians proclaim that &ldquo;young people are the future,&rdquo; they mean we&rsquo;ll inherit mountains of debt and a destroyed environment. But when young people think about our own futures, we should look at the way middle-aged and older people are treated&mdash;because like it or not, that&rsquo;s going to be us one day. If young people were really so smart, we wouldn&rsquo;t forget that.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><em>Read next: <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3559340\/instagram-tween-girls\/?xid=time_readnext\"

To put it simply, there are three types of people in this world: people who love the idea of dressing their infants in &#8220;leatherette skirts,&#8221; people who have no idea what a &#8220;leatherette skirt&#8221; is and people who fear a &#8220;leatherette skirt&#8221; will doom their innocent baby to a lifetime of sex tapes, 72 day marriages and questionable taste in floral print.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/timeinterstellarcover.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\"><em>Interstellar<\/em>, Where No Movie Has Gone Before<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547825\/nucor-tries-to-reverse-decline-in-american-steelmaking\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Last Men of Steel<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547828\/review-interstellar-christopher-nolan\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Review: <em>Interstellar\u2019s<\/em> Wonder of Worlds Beyond<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Professional Concerned Mother, Amie Logan of Roeland Park, Kansas, falls into the third category and tried to rally fellow moms in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/toys-r-us-stop-selling-kardashian-kids-clothing\">petition<\/a> to ban Kardashian Kids from Babies R Us. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my child to grow up to be a sex tape star,&rdquo; Logan&#8217;s Change.org petition <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/style\/mom-wants-damaging-kardashian-kollection-pulled-101190905778.html\">initially<\/a> read. &ldquo;You pulled the Breaking Bad toys because they promoted drug use. You should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well. The madness has to stop. If the toys are damaging so is the clothing.&rdquo; Logan later withdrew the petition, saying that she had just wanted to start a conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Considering that Babies R Us is a company that until recently felt totally <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3524685\/breaking-bad-toys-r-us-walter-white\/\" target=\"_blank\">comfortable selling action figures of meth dealers<\/a>, it&#8217;s unlikely it will pull Kardashian Kids. (In fact, the store recently said as much to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/11\/03\/petition-kardashian-kids-babies-r-us_n_6093964.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post<\/a>.) But Logan&#8217;s concern&#8211;and that of the 2,941 moms who signed her petition&#8211;is just one more example of the shaming that&#8217;s been associated with Kim Kardashian&#8217;s name ever since she made her sex tape.<\/p>\n<p>Many adults don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with two people filming their consensual &#8220;love making,&#8221; but ever since Kim&rsquo;s then-partner, Ray J, sold their x-rated tape to Vivid Entertainment, her public life&#8217;s been judged. For those of you who blocked out this harrowing time in early aughts pop culture, Kim filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment and eventually <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eonline.com\/news\/55028\/kardashian-gets-cash-closure-for-sex-tape\">settled<\/a> for somewhere around $5 million. In other words, she turned exploit into profit, and made the first of many solid business decisions&#8211;including Kardashian Kids, which I&#8217;m guessing will do quite well considering the Kardashian reign of success.<\/p>\n<p>The tabloid-reading denizens of middle America (myself included) have accepted most of Kim&#8217;s business pursuits as a natural by-product of her status as a sex star (<em>of course <\/em>she&#8217;d design lingerie&#8211;and more power to her.) But, her foray into children&#8217;s clothing crosses a line for parents like Amie Logan, who fear Kim has no place at the family dinner table&mdash;or, shall we say, changing table. &#8220;I would not choose to put my daughter in these clothes, and because the Kardashians are not people that have the family values that I uphold,&#8221; Logan&#8217;s petition now reads (having been updated since the initial post). &#8220;This whole petition, and the very negative responses I have received, has gotten larger than I ever expected when I started it last week. In the end it did get people discussing the issue&hellip;The original article seemed to leave out that this petition wasn&rsquo;t a crusade, but a means to get people discussing who should be raising their children, and what things retailers have the right to sell.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3559185\"><\/div>\n<p>While I don&#8217;t want Kim Kardashian <em>raising<\/em> my children (though I would take Khloe as a sassy godmother and I wouldn&#8217;t mind an Hermes Birkin bag no matter whose drawing is on the front) I&#8217;m fine having my kids grow up with Kim and her sister-friends on the sidelines of their lives. With a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/profile\/kim-kardashian\/\">net worth <\/a>of $28 million, Kim has been at the center of a successful reality franchise, owns a chain of boutiques with her siblings, has lent her name to multiple clothing lines and even made a tanning lotion titled Kardashian Glamour Tan. Plus, let&#8217;s not forget the highly addictive waste of time that is the game <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood<\/em>, which could <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/maseenaziegler\/2014\/07\/16\/why-kim-kardashian-hollywood-is-a-200-million-hit-app\/\">earn<\/a> a predicted $200 million in 2014. In an industry that&#8217;s still dominated by men, shouldn&#8217;t Kim be celebrated as a successful businesswoman by us and our leatherette-wearing kids?<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3457862\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Feminism is more on trend than ever with stars like Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Miley Cyrus self-identifying with The F-Word. While there&#8217;s been some backlash against calling Kim Kardashian a feminist (Jezebel accurately <a href=\"http:\/\/jezebel.com\/is-kim-kardashian-a-feminist-role-model-975647442\">points out <\/a>that she represents impossible beauty standards that play into &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221;), there&#8217;s no denying that she&#8217;s a model of female success among a sea of male entrepreneurs. So, what exactly is the problem with our kids growing up with her name plastered on their clothing?<\/p>\n<p>No child will be fated to a life of sex tapes and loose morals simply by wearing Kardashian Kids at the tender age of two. And, to be honest, most of the clothes look like something you&#8217;d find at Baby Gap (only designed by whoever makes Kanye West&#8217;s pants). Toddlers would probably go through life blissfully ignorant of their leatherette skirt&#8217;s sinister plans if it weren&#8217;t for their parents teaching them that there&#8217;s something innately wrong with clothing designed by a former sex tape star.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no denying that Kim Kardashian&#8217;s empire rests on a foundation of overt sexuality, but let&#8217;s admire the fact that she successfully built said empire on her own. Sure, some of Kim&#8217;s endorsements are less than inspired (Charmin Toilet Paper, for one), but she did what she had to do to succeed, and her business decisions are only getting more daring &ndash;&ndash; especially now that she&#8217;s a mom to burgeoning fashion icon North West. Just look at Kardashian Kids: instead of a bright pink palette, the line gives off a progressive, cutting-edge vibe with <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3263667\/kim-kardashian-north-kanye-fashion\/\" target=\"_blank\">gender-neutral tones<\/a> and the implied message that girls don&#8217;t have to be overtly &#8220;girly&#8221; to be feminine.<\/p>\n<p>Kim once mused, &#8220;I have so much going on in my life. I never wanted anyone to think of me as Kim Kardashian, sex tape star.&#8221; There&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s hard to shake this notion, but fans and haters alike should learn to look past Kim&#8217;s tape and start applauding her for being both a successful momtrepreneur and a potential business role model for our children. No, I don&#8217;t want my daughter building an empire based on her looks, but I do want her building an empire as successful as Kim Kardashian&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p><span id=\"OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION\"><div class=\"newsletter-shortcode parents\">\n<form action=\"https:\/\/ebm.cheetahmail.com\/r\/regf2\" method=\"post\" target=\"time_brief_popup\" onsubmit=\"window.open(this.action, 'time_brief_popup', 'width=486,height=250');\">\n    <label class=\"intro\"><small>Sign Up for<\/small> <img src=\"http:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/time2014\/img\/parents-logo.png\" width=\"90\" \/><small class=\"and-more\">and more<\/small>  <small class=\"example\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/parents\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small><\/label>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"n\" value=\"4\">\n    <input name=\"aid\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1078532063\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fsub\" value=\"2096280873\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"TIME_SOURCE\" value=\"shortcode_parents\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"re\" value=\"http:\/\/f.time.chtah.net\/i\/30\/1078532063\/thanks.html\">\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"text input-field email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" class=\"submit button\" value=\"Submit\">\n<small class=\"example after\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/parents\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small>\n<\/form>\n<\/div><\/span><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3559185\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Reasons%20It%E2%80%99s%20Ok%20to%20Dress%20Your%20Kid%20in%20Kardashian%20Baby%20Clothes%20%7C%20TIME&body=Reasons%20It%E2%80%99s%20Ok%20to%20Dress%20Your%20Kid%20in%20Kardashian%20Baby%20Clothes%0A%0AKim%20Kardashian%20has%20thrived%20in%20male-dominated%20businesses%20like%20television%20and%20gaming.%20Shouldn%27t%20she%20be%20celebrated%20as%20a%20successful%20businesswoman%20by%20us%20and%20our%20leatherette-wearing%20kids%3F%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3559185%2Fkim-kardashian-kids-clothing-babies-r-us%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3559185%2Fkim-kardashian-kids-clothing-babies-r-us%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-eVUd&text=Reasons%20it%27s%20ok%20to%20dress%20your%20kid%20in%20Kardashian%20baby%20clothes&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3559185%2Fkim-kardashian-kids-clothing-babies-r-us%2F&title=Reasons+It%E2%80%99s+Ok+to+Dress+Your+Kid+in+Kardashian+Baby+Clothes\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3559185\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3559185\/kim-kardashian-kids-clothing-babies-r-us\/\" data-title=\"Reasons It&amp;#8217;s Ok to Dress Your Kid in Kardashian Baby Clothes\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on society, relationships, parenting, sex, psychology, aging, gender, career, women's issues, marriage, love and more"},"tags":"Amie Logan|Babies R Us|change.org|Kansas Mom|Kardashian Kids|Kim Kardashian|north west|Petition","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/north-west-071.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/north-west-071.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/north-west-071.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/north-west-071.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/north-west-071.jpg?w=974"},"credit":"Diabolik\/Splash News\/Corbis","caption":"Kim Kardashian takes baby North West on a late night flight from LAX Airport in Los Angeles, CA, on August 10, 2014.

The competition for &ldquo;likes&rdquo; encourages creativity in young users, who can use filters and other devices to spruce up their images. And its simplicity &ndash; it&rsquo;s just pictures, right? &#8212; comforts parents haunted by the cyberbullying they hear about on Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But Instagram&rsquo;s simplicity is also deceiving: look more closely, and you find the Rosetta Stone of girl angst: a way for tweens and teens to find out what their peers really think of them (<i>Was that comment about my dress a joke or did she mean it?<\/i>), who likes you (<i>Why wasn&rsquo;t I included in that picture?<\/i>), even how many people like them (if you post and get too few likes, you might feel &ldquo;Instashame,&rdquo; as one young woman calls it). They can obsess over their friendships, monitoring social ups and downs in extreme detail. They can strategically post at high traffic hours when they know peers are killing time between homework assignments. &ldquo;Likes,&rdquo; after all, feel like a public, tangible, reassuring statement of a girl&rsquo;s social status.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That&rsquo;s not what the app creators intended, of course, but it does make psychological sense: as they become preteens, research shows that girls&rsquo; confidence takes a nosedive. Instagram, then, is a new way for girls to chase the feeling of being liked that eludes so many of them. Instagram becomes an popularity meter and teens learn to manipulate the levers of success.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here are a few of the ways that girls are leveraging Instagram to do much more than just share photos:<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>To Know What Friends Really Think Of Them<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In the spot where adults tag a photo&rsquo;s location, girls will barter &#8220;likes&#8221; in exchange for other things peers desperately want: a &ldquo;TBH&rdquo; (or &#8220;to be honest&#8221;). Translation? If you like a girl&#8217;s photo, she&#8217;ll leave you a TBH comment. For example: &#8220;TBH, ILYSM,&#8221; meaning, &#8220;To be honest I love you so much.&#8221; Or, the more ambivalent: &#8220;TBH, We don&#8217;t hang out that much.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> To Measure How Much a Friend Likes You<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this case, a girl may trade a &#8220;like&#8221; &#8212; meaning, a friend will like her photo &#8212; in exchange for another tidbit of honesty: a 1-10 rating, of how much she likes you, your best physical feature, and a numerical scale that answers the question of &#8220;are we friends?&#8221; and many others. Girls hope for a &#8220;BMS,&#8221; or break my scale, the ultimate show of affection.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>As a Public Barometer of Popularity<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instagram lets you tag your friends to announce that you&rsquo;ve posted a new photo of them. Girls do the app one better: they take photos of scenes where no person is present &ndash; say, a sunset &#8212; but still tag people they love and add gushing comments. It&rsquo;s a kind of social media mating call for BFFs. But girls also do it because the number of tags you get is a public sign of your popularity. &ldquo;How many photos you&rsquo;re tagged in is important,&rdquo; says Charlotte, 12. &ldquo;No one can see the actual number but you can sort of just tell because you keep seeing their name pop up.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>To Show BFF PDA<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That broken heart necklace you gave your bestie? It&rsquo;s gone the way of dial up. Now, girls use Instagram biographies &ndash; a few lines at the top of their page &#8212; to trumpet their inner circle. It&rsquo;s a thrill to be featured on the banner that any visitor to the page will see &#8212; but not unusual to get deleted after a fight or bad day, in plain, humiliating sight of all your friends.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3559340\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>A Way to Retaliate<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Angry at someone? Don&rsquo;t tag the girl who is obviously in a picture, crop her out of it entirely, refuse to follow back the one who just tried to follow you, or simply post a photo a girl is not in. These are cryptic messages adults miss but which girls hear loud and clear. A girl may post an image of a party a friend wasn&rsquo;t invited to, an intimate sleepover or night out at a concert. She never even has to mention the absent girl&rsquo;s name. She knows the other girl saw it. That&rsquo;s the beauty of Instagram: it&rsquo;s the homework you know girls always do.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>A Personal Branding Machine<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Girls face increasing pressure not only to be smart and accomplished, but girly, sexy and social. In a 2011 survey, 74% of teen girls told the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.girlscouts.org\/research\/pdf\/whosthatgirl_tipsforgirls.pdf\"><span class=\"s1\">Girl Scout Research Institute<\/span><\/a> that girls were living quasi-double lives online, where they intentionally downplayed their intelligence, kindness and good influence &ndash; and played up qualities like fun, funny and social. On Instagram, girls can project a persona they may not have time, or permission, to show off in the classroom: popular, social, sexy. Cultivating a certain look is so important that it&#8217;s common for girls to stage &#8216;photo shoots&#8217; with each other as photographers to produce shots that stand out visually. (Plus a joint photo shoot is more evidence of friendship.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>A Place For Elaborate Birthday Collages<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Remember coming to school on your big day, excited to see what you&rsquo;d find plastered to your locker? Now girls can see who&rsquo;s celebrating them hours before they get off the bus. Birthday collages on Instagram are elaborate public tributes, filled with inside jokes, short videos, and pictures of memories you may not have been a part of. &ldquo;There is definitely a &lsquo;I love you the most. I&#8217;ve loved you the longest edge to these birthday posts,&rdquo; one parent told me. Collages that document the intensity or length of a relationship are a chance to celebrate a friend &ndash; or prove just how close you are to the birthday girl. Although most girls know to expect something from their closest friends, not getting one is seen as a direct diss, a parent told me. And it can be competitive: another parent told me her daughter&rsquo;s friend stayed up until midnight just so she could be the first to post.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">While girls may seem addicted to their online social lives, it&#8217;s not all bad &#8212; and they still prefer the company of an offline friend to any love they have to click for. (In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.girlscouts.org\/research\/pdf\/whosthatgirl_tipsforgirls.pdf\"><span class=\"s3\">survey<\/span><\/a> that would surely surprise some parents, 92% of teen girls said they would give up all of their social media friends if it meant keeping their best friend.) And, of course, likes aren&#8217;t everything. As 13 year-old Leah told me, &ldquo;Just because people don&rsquo;t write me a paragraph on Instagram doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Rachel Simmons is the

And good luck trying to stand between a child and their yearly candy harvest. It becomes a daily battle that almost always ends with someone near tears. (Usually me.) Is the only course of action left to eat all the candy myself?<\/p>\n<p>I could always blame Jimmy Kimmel. The late night comedian staged his now-annual<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3556244\/jimmy-kimmel-halloween-candy-prank\/\" target=\"_blank\"> Halloween prank<\/a> where he has parents inform their children they ate all their Halloween candy and record the inevitable meltdown. The reactions are both funny and sad, but while some saw the prank as uproarious and others viewed it as a cruel hoax, I thought: Hey, that&#8217;s not a bad idea. If the candy just disappeared, the struggle would be over in one fell swoop. Off with the proverbial band-aid and on with the limited intake of sugar. But it&#8217;s kind of mean and the ensuing tantrum would not be fun to weather. As a parent, though, do I need to make <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/109196\/10-easy-ways-to-slash-sugar-from-your-diet\/\" target=\"_blank\">the healthy choice<\/a> for my kid, whether he likes it or not?<\/p>\n<p>In general, my kid can usually take or leave sugary <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3550948\/lower-income-nutrition\/\" target=\"_blank\">junk food<\/a>, but he spent a lot of energy collecting his plus-sized bag of Halloween treats and seems to view it as his own personal Candy Land version of Mt. Everest. Like a wizened mountaineer, he must surmount it, simply because it&#8217;s there. At this point, if the FDA had an RDA, or Recommended Dietary Allowances, of carnauba wax, I assure you, it&#8217;s been met as he determinedly makes his way over Mt. CandyCoatedChocolate. He doesn&#8217;t care about my equally large mountain of studies showing that while delicious, copious amounts of sugar are simply <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3556608\/healthy-desserts\/\" target=\"_blank\">not healthy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-shortcode parents\">\n<form action=\"https:\/\/ebm.cheetahmail.com\/r\/regf2\" method=\"post\" target=\"time_brief_popup\" onsubmit=\"window.open(this.action, 'time_brief_popup', 'width=486,height=250');\">\n    <label class=\"intro\"><small>Sign Up for<\/small> <img src=\"http:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/time2014\/img\/parents-logo.png\" width=\"90\" \/><small class=\"and-more\">and more<\/small>  <small class=\"example\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/parents\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small><\/label>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"n\" value=\"4\">\n    <input name=\"aid\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1078532063\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fsub\" value=\"2096280873\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"TIME_SOURCE\" value=\"shortcode_parents\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"re\" value=\"http:\/\/f.time.chtah.net\/i\/30\/1078532063\/thanks.html\">\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"text input-field email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" class=\"submit button\" value=\"Submit\">\n<small class=\"example after\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/parents\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<p>But what is a parent to do when it comes to squaring off against a bag-full of treats?

Normally we were allowed no processed sweets&mdash;seriously, I got a box of sugary cereal from Santa each year, otherwise it was all health food store versions of Cheerios&mdash;so Halloween was a bonanza for us and a nightmare for my mother. Each year she had a new approach to the onslaught of sugar. One year we were allowed two pieces a day, which stretched the candy consumption until March and quickly became a supposedly fun-sized thing she would never do again. The next year we were told to eat all we wanted on Halloween and the rest would be done away with, the result being a now-infamous evening of candy-colored vomiting. After that, each year the candy trove seemed to be eaten by the dog, despite the fact that the stash was hidden on a tall shelf in the back of a closet and the dog was an overweight corgi with no vertical lift.<\/p>\n<p>As a parent now, blaming the dog for a disappearing candy hoard doesn&#8217;t seem like a bad option at all, but I think I am going to attempt to strike a balance. I&#8217;ll let him have a few pieces a day for a few more days, while carefully supervising brushing and flossing and vegetable intake and side-eying a copy of the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/67532\/how-to-quit-sugar-for-a-year\/\" target=\"_blank\">Year of No Sugar<\/a>. After a week of daily candy intake, though, it might be time to take a page from my mother&#8217;s book and blame the dog when the stash disappears.<\/p>\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t have a dog, well, there&#8217;s always Jimmy Kimmel to blame.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1NDkVx9AzSY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3558323\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Is%20Your%20Kid%20Still%20Eating%20Halloween%20Candy%3F%20Read%20This.%20%7C%20TIME&body=Is%20Your%20Kid%20Still%20Eating%20Halloween%20Candy%3F%20Read%20This.%0A%0AWhat%20is%20a%20parent%20to%20do%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20squaring%20off%20against%20a%20bag-full%20of%20treats%3F%20%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3558323%2Fhalloween-candy-jimmy-kimmel-prank%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3558323%2Fhalloween-candy-jimmy-kimmel-prank%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-eVGj&text=Is%20Your%20Kid%20Still%20Eating%20Halloween%20Candy%3F%20Read%20This.&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3558323%2Fhalloween-candy-jimmy-kimmel-prank%2F&title=Is+Your+Kid+Still+Eating+Halloween+Candy%3F+Read+This.\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3558323\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3558323\/halloween-candy-jimmy-kimmel-prank\/\" data-title=\"Is Your Kid &lt;i&gt;Still&lt;\/i&gt; Eating Halloween Candy?

It also guarantees 25% of legislative seats to military appointees. Since more than 75% of lawmakers are required to enact any constitutional change, this gives the generals a de facto parliamentary veto.<\/p>\n<p>Talks aimed at amending these provisions, which were shamelessly included with the sole purpose of barring Suu Kyi from the nation&rsquo;s highest office, have gone nowhere, and the 69-year-old is attempting one last throw of the dice &mdash; appealing to Obama to put pressure on current President Thein Sein, himself a former junta general.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Democratic reform would not be successful alone with the parliament,&rdquo; Suu Kyi told assembled media.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody would argue against Burma&rsquo;s current constitution desperately needing revision, or pretend that reforms haven&#8217;t stalled. In fact, when Obama returns to Burma next week, he will find one of his few foreign policy successes in tatters.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The hope and the optimism we had in 2012, when the country was opening up, has all been squandered,&rdquo; Aung Zaw, managing editor of the <em>Irrawaddy <\/em>magazine, tells TIME, lamenting a &ldquo;backsliding reform process&rdquo; akin to watching &ldquo;a train wreck in slow motion.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Even so, Suu Kyi&rsquo;s condemnation is curious.<\/p>\n<p>It comes after her steadfast refusal to criticize the military or the government for myriad human-rights abuses. In Burma&rsquo;s west, for example, more than 100,000 Rohingya Muslims languish in squalid displacement camps, but Suu Kyi <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2013\/nov\/27\/aung-san-suu-kyi-is-turning-a-blind-eye-to-human-rights-in-the-name-of-politics\">repudiates<\/a> evidence-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2013\/04\/22\/burma-end-ethnic-cleansing-rohingya-muslims\">allegations<\/a> of ethnic cleansing by Human Rights Watch and instead <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/asia\/burmamyanmar\/9430518\/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-facing-backlash-for-silence-on-abuses.html\">calls<\/a> the crisis an &ldquo;immigration issue.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In northernmost Kachin state, civilians face &ldquo;attacks against civilian populations, extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, arbitrary arrest and detention, internal displacement, land confiscation, the recruitment of child soldiers, forced labor and portering.&rdquo; That&#8217;s been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ohchr.org\/Documents\/HRBodies\/HRCouncil\/RegularSession\/Session19\/A-HRC-19-67_en.pdf\">documented<\/a> by the U.N., but Suu Kyi has refused to condemn those atrocities. Her silence is so pointed that 23 local NGOs signed an open letter of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burmanet.org\/news\/2012\/09\/27\/kachin-news-group-open-letter-to-daw-aung-san-suu-kyi\/\">protest<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Other causes of concern, like the 10 journalists <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-28247691\">jailed<\/a> this year on the flimsiest of pretenses, are brushed aside with platitudinous references to the &ldquo;rule of law.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Suu Kyi&rsquo;s own Rule of Law Parliamentary Committee has achieved &ldquo;nothing at all,&rdquo; says Aung Zaw.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3560353\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;We would&rsquo;ve liked to have seen Aung San Suu Kyi speak on human-rights issues in a more forthright way,&rdquo; says Matthew Smith, executive director of the Fortify Rights advocacy group. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s issued equivocal statements on serious human-rights violations, in some cases amounting to crimes against humanity.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when a high-level delegation from Human Rights Watch came to Burma earlier this year for landmark talks, they met with senior government officials including the President but were snubbed by Suu Kyi.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s not all. Suu Kyi&#8217;s baffling behavior goes beyond the area of human rights.<\/p>\n<p>In April 2013, peaceful protesters blockaded a Chinese-owned copper mine near Monywa, around 450 miles north of Rangoon. The police <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-asia-21455087\">attacked them<\/a> using white phosphorous, leaving dozens with horrific burns, including traditionally sacrosanct Buddhist monks.<\/p>\n<p>Suu Kyi headed the investigation commission but found that the mine must continue operations or else risk &ldquo;hurting Burma,&rdquo; despite the fact that it is desecrating the environment, was set up without scrutiny by the junta, and provides no jobs for local people. In unprecedented scenes, the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader was <a href=\"http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/suu-kyi-meets-more-anger-over-myanmar-mine\">harangued<\/a> by furious locals.<\/p>\n<p>Suu Kyi has certainly experienced enormous personal sacrifice. Since returning to her homeland in 1988, she has spent 15 years under house arrest, not even being able to see her beloved husband Michael Aris before he died.<\/p>\n<p>But this is also why her current aloofness is so painful to behold.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The NLD under her leadership has had big question marks,&#8221; says Aung Zaw, &#8220;and they misread the whole situation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In August 2011, Suu Kyi met Thein Sein for the first time, formally marking her belated return to mainstream politics. The following April, she and 42 NLD colleagues were elected to parliament in a landslide amid jubilant scenes.<\/p>\n<p>The common perception among analysts is that some deal was struck to allow Suu Kyi to stand for election in exchange for muting her criticism of the generals. The presumption was that reforms would take baby steps forward. But, three years on, there has been no progress, and she is partly culpable.<\/p>\n<p>When Suu Kyi finally gave her Nobel acceptance speech in June 2012 &mdash; the prize having been originally bestowed in 1991 during a period of house arrest &mdash; she said that &ldquo;receiving the Nobel Peace Prize means personally extending my concerns for democracy and human rights beyond national borders.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But her present recalcitrance suggests that her own political career may be more important, even if we accept the mitigation that it is for some vague greater good.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no version of pragmatism that would make silence on human-rights atrocities defensible,&rdquo; says Smith. &ldquo;These are some of the most serious human-rights violations that can be committed.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Admittedly, Suu Kyi has always <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dvb.no\/news\/suu-kyi-i-started-as-a-politician-not-a-human-rights-defender\/33976\">said<\/a> she is a politician, rather than a human-rights defender.

They were repeated, forty years later, in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2013\/04\/15\/death-of-a-revolutionary?currentPage=all\" target=\"_blank\">the New Yorker&#8203;<\/a> by Susan Faludi&#8203;, who &#8203;described them as &#8220;one of the lines most frequently quoted by feminists.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8203;If Lena Dunham&#8217;s latest lambasting is any indication, the words are still applicable today. The vitriol of the sisterhood is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2013\/may\/02\/feminism-trashing-shulamith-firestone\" target=\"_blank\">alive<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewire.com\/politics\/2014\/01\/incomplete-guide-feminist-infighting\/357509\/\" target=\"_blank\">well<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The latest controversy over Dunham goes like this: Last month, the 28-year-old creator of <a href=\"http:\/\/search.time.com\/results.html?Ntt=girls+lena+dunham\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Girls<\/em><\/a> published a memoir, <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3425759\/lena-dunham-a-generations-gutsy-ambitious-voice\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Not That Kind of Girl<\/em><\/a>. In the book, much in the same way her HBO series does, Dunham takes on all sorts of taboos, in revealing, unfiltered, at times uncomfortable sections on virginity, sisterly intimacy and platonic bed sharing, date rape, and more. She is graphic in her sexual descriptions, including a passage where she describes, as a 7-year-old, looking inside her younger sister&#8217;s vagina (to discover that her sister had placed pebbles in it, presumably as a prank).<\/p>\n<p>The scene is cringe-inducing. It&#8217;s uncomfortable, no doubt. It&#8217;s also funny. I &#8203;laughed, &#8203;turned the page and kept reading. Little kids do bizarre things.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8203;t appeared that so did everybody else &#8212; until last week. That&rsquo;s when an article in the National Review &ndash; written by Kevin Williamson, a man notable for an article on how &ldquo;Laverne Cox Is Not a Woman&rdquo; and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KevinNR\/status\/516218876066287616\" target=\"_blank\">seeming to suggest that women who get abortions should be hanged<\/a><b>-<\/b>- eviscerated Dunham for the chapter in her book about rape (he questioned why, if the story of an assault she suffered in college were truthful, she never &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3518282\/lena-dunham-national-review-cover-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">felt the need to press charges, file a complaint, or otherwise document the encounter<\/a>.&rdquo;) The right&#8203;-wing website TruthRevolt then picked up the &#8203;thread, &#8203;homed in on the sisterly vagina scene &#8203;(along with a typo stating that Dunham was <em>seventeen<\/em> not 7) and declared in a headline (over which Dunham is now allegedly suing): &#8220;Lena Dunham describes sexually molesting her sister.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the version of things in my head, here&#8217;s how I would have expected this scenario to play out: &#8203;<\/p>\n<p>A few right wing publications and gossip blogs would pick up the story. &#8203;The New York Post would write a &#8203;snarky headline. &#8203;Dunham would respond &#8203;on Twitter (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/ryanhatesthis\/lena-dunham-responds-to-sex-abuse-claims\">which she did<\/a>). Her sister, who is her best friend and tour manager, would chime in (<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3554403\/lena-dunham-rage-spiral-media\/\">which she did<\/a>). Feminists would jump to her defense. What she did as a seven-year-old may bother people, but that&rsquo;s precisely Dunham&rsquo;s form of art. That doesn&rsquo;t make it abuse.<\/p>\n<p>And yet&#8203;&#8230;&#8203; here is how it did play out. &#8203;Dunham was swiftly called a &#8220;predator without remorse&#8221; &#8212; mostly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23DropDunham&amp;src=tyah\" target=\"_blank\">by other feminists<\/a> on Twitter.&#8203; She was compared to R. Kelly, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2014\/10\/31\/after-jian-ghomeshi-is-the-world-finally-starting-to-turn-against-bill-cosby\/\">Bill Cosby<\/a>, and Jian Ghomeshi. She became the subject of a hashtag, #DropDunham, which called on Planned Parenthood &ndash; which has joined Dunham on a number of stops on her book tour &ndash; to disassociate from her immediately.<\/p>\n<p>&#8203;And on feminist listservs, Tumblr blogs and elsewhere, the pile-on began. She was &#8220;creepy.&#8221; &#8220;Not normal.&#8221; A &#8220;self-promoter.&#8221; &#8220;Full of herself.&#8221; A woman who needs to &#8220;sit the f&#8211;k down and learn something.&#8221; &#8203;She was told to &#8220;get some boundaries.&#8221; To &#8220;stop being weird.&#8221; Her story was, as one blogger <a href=\"theflounce.com\/lena-dunham-white-feminism-cant-nice-things\/\" target=\"_blank\">put it<\/a>, &#8220;best kept in the confines of your family kitchen over Thanksgiving.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This was not the National Review talking. These were fellow feminists.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, she had defenders: Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that suggesting &#8220;a 7 yr-old girl is even capable of &#8216;molestation&#8217; is vile&#8203;&#8221;; a sex researcher at the Kinsey Institute wrote that &#8220;it&#8217;s normal for kids to explore with each other;&#8221; prominent feminist voices like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rgay\/status\/528692436009508864\" target=\"_blank\">Roxane Gay<\/a> (who called Dunham &#8220;gutsy&#8221; and &#8220;audacious&#8221; in a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3425759\/lena-dunham-a-generations-gutsy-ambitious-voice\/\" target=\"_blank\">review <\/a>of her book), <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KathaPollitt\/status\/529679977936338944\" target=\"_blank\">Katha Pollitt<\/a> (who donated to Planned Parenthood in Dunham&#8217;s honor); and a group of women who launched a <a href=\"http:\/\/thosekindsofgirls.tumblr.com\/\">Tumblr<\/a> to curate all sorts of youthful (and at times unsettling) stories of sexual exploration. &#8203;(Dunham <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3556513\/lena-dunham-sexual-abuse-controversy\/\">responded<\/a> again, too, writing in <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3556513\/lena-dunham-sexual-abuse-controversy\/\" target=\"_blank\">TIME<\/a> that she takes abuse seriously and noting that her sister had given permission for her to publish the story.)<\/p>\n<p>And yet the vitriol from her critics was so intense, so personal, so almost gleeful, that it was hard not to wonder if this was really about Lena Dunham at all.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3556776\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even seen this level of outrage over Bill Cosby,&#8221; one friend commented, referring to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2014\/09\/timeline-of-the-abuse-charges-against-cosby.html\" target=\"_blank\">allegations of sexual abuse<\/a> against Cosby.<\/p>\n<p>Why, whenever there is a powerful woman speaking about feminism publicly (including, ahem: Sheryl Sandberg, and please see the disclosure in my bio) must they become so polarizing as to make feminism, as one journalist put it, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/irin\/status\/529319048191180800\" target=\"_blank\">a bipartisan issue<\/a>&#8220;?&#8203; (It&#8217;s worth noting that among my cohort, anyway, there has been far more discussion about Dunham than about the <em>elections<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Feminism is about giving women equal opportunity, equal voice, equal power. And yet, over and over again, when female voices attain that power, we &ndash; other women &ndash; parse and analyze their every move, public and personal, with an absurdly critical eye. We see it in politics, in pop culture, in film. From Hillary Clinton to Sandberg to <a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/thecut\/2013\/02\/why-do-women-hate-hathaway-but-love-lawrence.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Hathaway<\/a>. (As Roxane Gay put it in a piece for <a href=\"http:\/\/therumpus.net\/2013\/02\/how-a-wound-heals\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Rumpus<\/a>, &ldquo;Young women in Hollywood cannot win, no matter what they do.&rdquo;)<\/p>\n<p>To be clear: There are plenty of people who think Dunham&rsquo;s behavior toward her sister was questionable, and that&rsquo;s a valid argument to have. (Though &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; is a whole lot different from &ldquo;molestation&#8221; <a href=\"\/\/www.salon.com\/2014\/11\/04\/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham\/\" target=\"_blank\">so say the experts<\/a>.) There are others who&rsquo;ve argued that acknowledging Dunham&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2014\/11\/04\/will-white-feminists-finally-dump-lena-dunham.html\" target=\"_blank\">race, and privileged background<\/a>, are crucial to this conversation. (I happen to disagree &ndash; but that too, is a discussion worth having.)<\/p>\n<p>But this has become a witch hunt &ndash; and it has everything to do with&#8203; how we view women <em>like<\/em> Dunham.<\/p>\n<p>Feminism has a long history of what Ms. Magazine, in a 1976 piece by Jo Freeman, called &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jofreeman.com\/joreen\/trashing.htm\" target=\"_blank\">trashing<\/a>.&rdquo; That is, taking jabs at women who suddenly rise up, helping elevate them, but then tearing them down when they become too successful. &ldquo;This standard,&rdquo; Freeman wrote, &ldquo;is clothed in the rhetoric of revolution and feminism. But underneath are some very traditional ideas about women&rsquo;s proper roles.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Dunham is a perfect target for trashing &ndash; because she doesn&rsquo;t fit into our traditional molds. She is loud, out there, imperfect, messy, and some might say maybe even a little gross. She speaks openly about feminism, and sex, the ambiguity of consent, and she doesn&rsquo;t apologize for it. She makes people uncomfortable. And while she may have risen up propelled by the support of other women, somewhere along the way, she lost her likability &ndash; as powerful women often do. She is just a little too loud, a little too unapologetic, a little too overtly sexual, a little &hellip; successful.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t make her a molester.<\/p>\n<p>Dunham has always presented herself as flawed. She has never made herself a paragon, or claimed to represent us all. Yes, her character on <em>Girls<\/em> called herself a &ldquo;voice of her generation.&rdquo; She is also not her character (and has said repeatedly that it was just a line). And she&rsquo;s not a politician, she&rsquo;s an artist. It is her <em>job<\/em> is to push boundaries. To speak loudly. And, yes, to self-promote &ndash; and sell books.<\/p>\n<p>Dunham&#8217;s accomplishments are what feminists should want women to aspire to: she is the writer, director and star, making art about women, from a woman&#8217;s point of view, in an industry that is still dominated by men. She doesn&#8217;t represent all women &#8212; and she shouldn&#8217;t have to. But she is willing to say what many other high-profile women won&rsquo;t (at least not publicly). Yes, she has a voice that creates controversy. Yes, she makes people uncomfortable.<\/p>\n<p>But why do we hold her to a seemingly higher standard? Why must her voice represent us all?<\/p>\n<p>No one can be &#8220;everything to everybody,&#8221; Freeman wrote back in 1976. And neither can Lena Dunham. Like her, don&rsquo;t like her. Watch <em>Girls<\/em>, don&#8217;t watch it. But let&#8217;s not forget: There is room for more women than Lena Dunham at the top.<\/p>\n<p><i>Jessica Bennett is a contributing columnist at <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Time.com<\/i><\/span><\/a><i> covering the intersection of gender, sexuality, business and pop culture.

It&#8217;s unwelcome because these calls aren&#8217;t support groups. Investors tune in to decide whether they should buy, sell or hold a company&#8217;s stock.<\/p>\n<p>Take Google. On a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/2568635-google-goog-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?find=thrill&amp;all=false\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call<\/a>, Citigroup analyst Mark May asked a reasonable question about <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/compute\/\" target=\"_blank\">Compute Engine<\/a>, Google&#8217;s cloud services platform. &ldquo;What sort of impact is that having on revenue or expenses and capex for the business?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&#8217;re really thrilled by the momentum,&rdquo; Google CFO Patrick Pichette replied.<\/p>\n<p>A no comment would have sufficed here. But Pichette offered less than a no-comment, a comment of negative value, a subjective emotion as answer to a mathematical question. It&#8217;s like ordering food at a restaurant and being served a picture of someone who just had a yummy meal. It neither nourishes nor satisfies.<\/p>\n<p>And yet Pichette and Chief Business Officer Omid Kordestani went on to mention how thrilled they were about this or that (<i>we&#8217;re thrilled to be a platform!<\/i>) six more times during the call. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a thrill as &ldquo;an intense emotion or excitement&rdquo; that causes &ldquo;a subtle nervous tremor.&rdquo; The word comes from the English &ldquo;thirl,&rdquo; meaning to pierce something with a sharp instrument&ndash;to bore it, which is what Pichette and Kordestani were doing to their audience.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3550055\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>Nor were they the only corporate thrillseekers. &ldquo;Overall, I&rsquo;m <a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/2621475-groupons-grpn-ceo-eric-lefkofsky-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?find=thrill&amp;all=false\" target=\"_blank\">thrilled<\/a> with the progress we made across all of our initiatives,&rdquo; Groupon CEO Eric Lefkofsky said on Thursday. But at least Groupon&#8217;s stock rose 25% on the evidence of that progress. So even if Lefkofsky wasn&#8217;t exactly atremble with joy over the company&#8217;s progress, the surge in value Friday of his Groupon shares surely enlivened his mood.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3553806\"><\/div>\n<p>Not so for Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook&#8217;s shares fell 10% on warnings of slower growth and heavier spending. The normally low-key Zuckerberg had no thrills to report but he does get excited pretty easily&ndash;<a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/2607755-facebooks-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?find=thrill&amp;all=false\" target=\"_blank\">nine times<\/a> in last week&#8217;s earnings call. Most people in the Bay Area get excited when the Giants win the World Series, but for Zuckerberg it&#8217;s a new ad platform, deep linking or &ldquo;partnering with credit card companies.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This is fine, in a nerdy way. But the point is, on Wall Street nobody cares about excitement levels, even with an influential executive like Zuckerberg. The numbers Facebook delivered meant everything in the selloff. The emotional state over at Hacker Way meant nothing. So why do executives even bother?<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the hyperbole defies common sense, as when Greg Blatt, chairman of IAC&#8217;s Match Group, which owns OKCupid and Tinder, explained that Tinder isn&#8217;t being monetized right now but that he &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/2611655-iac-interactivecorp-iaci-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?all=true&amp;find=happier\" target=\"_blank\">couldn&#8217;t be happier.<\/a>&rdquo; But wouldn&#8217;t surging revenue and profits from the popular Tinder app make him happier? Because it would probably make investors in IAC feel better.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the king of earnings hyperbole is Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook. Which seems strange because Cook gives off this constant Zen vibe. &ldquo;It&#8217;s just absolutely stunning,&rdquo; Cook said about Mac sales to a group of investors who were completely not stunned. Later, Cook added, &ldquo;I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>At one point in <a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/2576865-apples-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">last week&#8217;s call<\/a>, Cook said he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be happier&#8221; about Apple&#8217;s ability to supply its new iPhone lines. Then, only a few seconds later, he said he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t be happier with the way demand looks.&#8221; Which is either a direct contradiction or a crazy business koan that, once cracked, will yield immediate enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p>The effect of such relentless hyperbole is that, when companies do have good news to be excited about, investors just dismiss it as more hollow rhetoric. Instead, it&#8217;s the immediate, often knee-jerk reaction to the stock price that sets the consensus on how well or poorly a company is performing financially. The thicker the happy feelings are layered on, the more they are distrusted as more corporate spin.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, such grandiose language is also to be found outside of the tech industry. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz on Friday said he was &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/2621935-starbucks-sbux-ceo-howard-schultz-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?all=true&amp;find=%22beyond+thrilled%22\" target=\"_blank\">beyond thrilled<\/a>&rdquo; to be announcing&mdash;not blowout profits or guidance surpassing Wall Street&#8217;s hopes&mdash;but a <a href=\"http:\/\/news.starbucks.com\/news\/starbucks-accelerates-growth-of-store-formats\" target=\"_blank\">new roastery<\/a> Starbucks is opening in December.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Schultz is on to something. Taking his words &ldquo;beyond thrilled&rdquo; at face value could be good advice for overexcited executives in general: Hurry up and get past your declarations thrills\/excitements\/pleasures. Because the rest of the market is already well beyond caring about them.<\/p>\n<p>And while you&#8217;re at it, more numbers would be helpful.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"

Only 27% of those surveyed said they are &#8220;completely balanced.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As a person who is solidly in the other 73%, one can only imagine these 27-percenters who tell a pollster that they are &#8220;completely balanced&#8221; must send their last work email precisely at 5:30pm, arise from their ergonomic chair to walk the eight flights down to their spotless car with nary a fast-food wrapper in site. They arrive home in time to cook a well-balanced meal of superfoods for their children who are eager to finish their homework before diving into a delicious plate that is up to the FDA&#8217;s latest nutritional standards. The kids brush their teeth in tiny circles for two minutes, floss and then head to their organic-sheeted beds to read their bedtime books in Japanese, their third language. They fall asleep immediately giving their parents plenty of time to watch the final episode of <em>Orange is the New<\/em> <em>Black<\/em> and get a full eight hours of sleep without once checking their work email.<\/p>\n<p>Being &#8220;completely balanced&#8221; sounds like you&#8217;re living in a catalog, which is great but some of us don&#8217;t have time to peruse a catalog.

That is a shame, because it has overshadowed the substantive reality explored in the piece.<\/p>\n<p>We know the vast majority of teachers are committed, caring and conscientious. They are not rotten; they are the core of our success stories in public schools.<\/p>\n<p>The real issue is covered in the body of the story itself, and in the victorious Vergara case on which the Time piece is based: tenure, dismissal and seniority laws that work to keep grossly ineffective teachers in class. The most telling anecdote came from the superintendent whose singular request to improve his schools was not more public money or supplies but &ldquo;control over my workforce.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because states with flawed teacher laws are doing the unfathomable. They are working against their own stated mission of teaching <em>all<\/em> children well. In New York, the courts have found that access to at least a sound, basic education is guaranteed by the state constitution &ndash; and yet state laws actually undermine that.<\/p>\n<p>It happens because tenure is granted to teachers long before school leaders have a reasonable chance to determine if those teachers are effective. It happens because dismissal laws make it nearly impossible for schools to fire teachers deemed grossly ineffective or even dangerous. It happens because teachers are laid off based solely on their level of seniority, without regard to their quality.<\/p>\n<p>That fact that it happens in a minority of cases still amounts to hundreds or thousands of children in a large district. And if it happens at all and we know about it, is that not a problem we should fix? Otherwise, what is the message sent to students who are taught by teachers who brazenly fail to lead or control their class, let alone inspire their students? Sorry kids, better luck next year?<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3544600\"><\/div>\n<p>Parents are turning to the courts as a last resort, as a matter of inspiration out of desperation. Years of legislative inaction and inertia inside school systems have offered no other choice. If elected leaders will not lead, parents are justified to question whether these laws causing such problems are even constitutional.<\/p>\n<p>The Time article mentions the New York case supported by my organization, but unfortunately describes the litigation in shorthand, calling it my lawsuit. It is not. I use my platform as a former TV journalist to draw attention to the cause. But the case belongs to the families who serve as plaintiffs, and they do not do it casually. It is not easy to take on the state government and the teachers&rsquo; unions.<\/p>\n<p>These parents are fighting because they want more good teachers in our schools. Turns out that, they, too, are trying to fix this. And they deserve our support.<\/p>\n<p><em>In search of more perspectives on TIME&rsquo;s cover?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Randi Weingarten<\/strong>, President of the American Federation of Teachers, responds <a href=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-eRe8?xid=time_readnext\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rep.
