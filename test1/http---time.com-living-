Making that call is a moral calculus: when do the negative aspects of a public figure outweigh the positive? Granted, in Bill Cosby&#8217;s case, we&#8217;re talking about a comedian, but the question is relevant for <em>The Cosby Show</em>&#8216;s legacy. Should I think less of <i>The Cosby Show</i>&#8216;s power to teach and to change perceptions of race in America if it turns out Bill Cosby is a rapist?</p>

For me, <em>The Cosby Show&#8217;s</em> legacy is personal. As a kid, the young Huxtables were among the few children on television with faces that looked like mine living well-adjusted upper middle class existences that resembled my own. When I considered my Cosby experience alongside the actor&#8217;s on-screen persona, a doctor and family man who combined life lessons with old-fashioned humor, I intuitively knew that he couldn&#8217;t be a serial rapist.</p>

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The </i><i>C</i><i>osby Show</i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?</p>
<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show </i>harm anyone, even indirectly?</p>
<p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href="http://time.com/3599978/cosby-show-reruns-rape/" target="_blank">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show</em>?</a>)</p>
<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599394"></div>
<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.</p>
<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show</em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son</em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.</p>
<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show </i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href="http://time.com/3596545/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video/" target="_blank">silence</a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3599394"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

<p><em>Intersex</em> is a term that refers to someone whose anatomy or genetics at birth&mdash;the X and Y chromosomes that are usually XX for women and XY for men&mdash;do not correspond to the typical expectations for either sex. The &#8220;I&#8221; is distinct from the &#8220;T&#8221; for transgender people, who are typically born with a biological sex that fits the norm for male or female and then grow up to identify with the opposite gender. Intersex babies are not obviously male or female to begin with, according to society&#8217;s general rules about what one&#8217;s physical characteristics and chromosomal makeup are supposed to signify.</p>
<p>As University of Oregon professor and intersex expert Elizabeth Reis writes in her book <em>Bodies in Doubt</em>, &#8220;In the United States and most other places, humans are men or they are women; they may not be neither or both. Yet not all bodies are clearly male or female.&#8221; That <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001669.htm" target="_blank">may mean</a> a child has typical female chromosomes and ovaries but external bodies parts of a male. Or it <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001669.htm" target="_blank">could mean</a> the body parts that a doctor typically looks to when declaring a baby to be a girl or boy are incompletely formed, or ambiguous. Sometimes it&#8217;s clear in the delivery room, sometimes intersex people don&#8217;t become aware of their status until they are teenagers and puberty doesn&#8217;t happen as expected.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599950"></div>
<p>Performing surgery on an intersex baby is controversial. In South Carolina, the parents of an adopted intersex child are suing a hospital and its employees for surgically assigning &#8220;M.C.&#8217;s&#8221; sex as female at 16-months-old. Now around 10 years old, the child identifies as a boy. &#8220;Genital &#8216;normalizing&#8217; surgery does not create or cement a gender identity; it just takes tissue away that the patient may want later,&#8221; writes the Intersex Society of North America in <a href="http://www.isna.org/faq/patient-centered" target="_blank">their position statement</a>. Some in the intersex community choose not to have any medically unnecessary surgeries to change how they were born, even after they are old enough to identify their own gender and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how common being intersex is (since it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency" target="_blank">debatable</a> which people belong under that umbrella term), medical experts say that genital anomalies occur in about 1 in 2,000 babies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the word <em>hermaphrodite</em> is considered insensitive and stigmatizing by many who see it as &#8220;vague, demeaning, and sensationalistic, conjuring mythic images of monsters and freaks,&#8221; as Reis writes. Some parents have also balked at the word <em>intersex</em>, pushed by activists in the 1990s, feeling it suggests their child has a third gender and can not be a girl or a boy. In the medical establishment, the wide variety of conditions that might be referred to as <em>intersex</em> are typically referred to as <em>disorders of sex development</em>. Reis has advocated shifting that to <em>divergence of sex development</em>, to avoid the connotations of <em>disorder</em>, much as <em>gender identity disorder</em> was <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf" target="_blank">rebranded <em>gender dysphoria</em></a> by medical professionals addressing transgender people.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3599950"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

Who, in their right mind, actually likes dealing with the post office?</p>
<p>A lot of people, it turns out. According to a new <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/179519/americans-rate-postal-service-highest-major-agencies.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank">Gallup</a> survey, 72% of Americans say the U.S. Postal Service is doing an excellent or good job. That puts the USPS ahead of 12 other government agencies, including the FBI, the CDC, NASA and the CIA. And the younger the respondent, the more likely they were to think highly of our much-maligned courier: 81% of 18-to-29-year-olds rated the post office&rsquo;s job as excellent or good, while 65% of those over 65 said the same thing.</p>
<p>So what accounts for the post office&#8217;s surprising popularity? Age, for one.</p>
<p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href="http://time.com/3585952/usps-postmaster-general-patrick-donahoe-retire/">The Postmaster General Hangs Up His Mail Bag, With a Parting Shot at Congress</a>)</p>
<p>As the volume of letters has declined, the USPS has evolved to become as much a courier of packages as it is a way to send and receive first-class mail. In the last few years, the post office has not only expanded its delivery of parcels (it recently began a partnership with <a href="http://time.com/3590662/usps-amazon-holiday-delivery-sunday-christmas/">Amazon to deliver on Sundays</a>), but it also often delivers packages for FedEx and UPS in what&#8217;s called &#8220;last mile&#8221; delivery, which are shipments to residents that private carriers don&#8217;t service. That means millennials interact less with the USPS at its worst &#8212; the interminable lines at understaffed post offices &#8212; and more from the comfort of home, where the mailman is the person at the door with their new shoes from Amazon or their iPhone from the Apple store.</p>
<p>The post office is also the one agency that Americans actually see doing its job each day. You see postal employees on their routes. You can see post offices open. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw an FDA worker inspecting your local restaurant or the Federal Reserve Board in action as it plotted the end of quantitative easing?</p>
<p>Not that the latest survey should make the post office rejoice. The faltering institution has <a href="http://time.com/3585952/usps-postmaster-general-patrick-donahoe-retire/">run deficits every year since 2007</a> and its aggressive efforts to adapt to the digital age have not yet been enough to offset the substantial drop <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/first-class-mail-since-1926.pdf" target="_blank">in mail volume</a> and onerous Congressional mandates to fund retirees. But it never hurts to have the public on your side.</p>

So what do the world&#8217;s richest man&#8217;s kids do with their money? Melinda Gates came to TIME&#8217;s offices to talk about her new focus on women and children and especially on <a href="http://www.familyplanning2020.org/" target="_blank">contraceptives</a>, but she spilled some secrets about how she tries to get her kids to be purposeful with their money.</p>
<p>First of all, she tries to be true to her values, to articulate them and live them out. Then, they do a lot of volunteering together, at &#8220;whatever tugs at their heartstrings&#8221; says Gates. And of course, they&#8217;ve traveled with her. &#8220;They have that connection I think to the developing world,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They see the difference a flock of chicks makes in a family&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s huge.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/3596976/10-questions-melinda-gates/" target="_blank">Read the 10 Questions with Melinda Gates here</a></p>
<p>Gates has always made a point of getting into the streets and poorer neighborhoods when she travels for meetings and conferences. And sometimes she takes her kids. It&#8217;s there, she says, that she meets mothers who tell her that their biggest struggle is having so many children. Although Gates was raised Catholic, she is heading up an initiative to get family planning information, contraceptives and services to 120 million more women by the year 2020. That includes new technology, better delivery system and a lot of education, including for men.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s similarly rigorous about her home life. Her kids save a third of their allowance and designate a charity they&#8217;d like to give it to. (They can also list donations to charities on their Christmas wish list.) As further incentive, their parents double whatever money they&#8217;ve saved. Which means they may be the only children in the world to get a matching grant from the Gates Foundation.</p>

    <div>As the year comes closer to an end, and Thanksgiving rolls around, it brings out many feelings and moments to reminisce. Each day we should be thankful for everything we have, but many times we take the simple things in life for granted. Waking up in the morning. Being able to hear, see and smell. Walking, running and jumping. These are all things that can be overlooked in our lives that are not guaranteed. We are all guilty of it, but being able to give thanks to God each day for everything he gives us makes life all the richer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am thankful for many things.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My wife and future mother of my children. I feel blessed to have a strong woman of God to tackle the ups and downs of this world with.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My family. I thank God for the blessing of two parents, Robert and Jacqueline Griffin, who lead by example and showed me and my sisters, De&#8217;Jon and Jihan, what it means to sacrifice for who and what you love.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am thankful to have true friends who are there through the good times and the bad, who show true loyalty and support. Time may pass but nothing will change, as we can pick up with the laughter and jokes right where we left off. Friends that keep the mood light and prove that life is great make me thankful each day.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am thankful for all the teammates I have had throughout my career in sports. The Cherubims from Church League basketball. The Bulldawgs from high school football. The Jack Rabbits from AAU track and field. There is something special about being a part of a team that words can not explain.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I am always thankful for all of my successes, but along with that comes my failures. Without the latter, I would not be able to learn from my mistakes and correct my path to create success. Going through the highs and lows of life has made me the man that I am today, and I am very thankful for that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lastly, I am thankful for the promise of a future. I know that God has many blessings in store for my life, and beyond that, I believe that he has life for us after this earth that will be grand beyond our imaginations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanksgiving can mean so many things, but as I think of what I am really thankful for, I know it is so much more than just a holiday. It&#8217;s a reminder to stay grateful for our wonderful lives.</div>
<div></div>
<div><em>Robert Griffin III is the quarterback for the Washington Redskins.</em></div>

		<div class="video-content"><p>Censorship matters to Lina Esco, whose new film <i>Free the Nipple</i> tells the story of a group of activists challenging laws by baring their chests in the streets.</p>
<p>For Esco, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about going topless, it&rsquo;s about equality.&rdquo; The movie grew out of a <a href="http://www.freethenipple.com/">real-life campaign </a>that questions a country that glorifies violence in the media but <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2053230_2053229_2053225,00.html">removes a woman </a>from a flight for breastfeeding her baby. As one of the fictional activists says in the trailer, &ldquo;Our sexuality has been taken away from us and is essentially being sold back to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The movement got a jump-start when Miley Cyrus, who has faced plenty of censorship herself, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/MileyCyrus/status/410651500541902848/photo/1">picture of herself</a> holding a fake nipple last December, accompanied by the hashtag #freethenipple. It&rsquo;s not lost on Esco that the sensationalism of a bunch of topless women can only help to spread the word about her cause. &ldquo;If I would have made a movie called &lsquo;Equality,&rsquo; and no one was going topless,&rdquo; she acknowledged to <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/11/19/free-the-nipple-exclusive-trailer/" target="_blank"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>, &ldquo;nobody would be talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Free the Nipple </i>hits theaters on Dec. 12.</p>

So even though there&#8217;s increased worldwide awareness about violence against women, the problem won&#8217;t be solved unless countries make significant policy and financial changes to support victims, according to a five-part series of studies in <em>The Lancet, </em>one of the world&#8217;s premier medical journals.</p>

Almost 70 million girls worldwide have been married before they turned 18. According to WHO estimates, 30% of women worldwide have experienced partner violence. The researchers said that these problems could only be solved with political action and increased funding, since the violence has continued &#8220;despite increased global attention,&#8221; implying awareness is not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;No magic wand will eliminate violence against women and girls,&#8221; series co-lead Charlotte Watts, founding Director of the Gender Violence and Health Centre at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said in a statement. &#8220;But evidence tells us that changes in attitudes and behavior are possible, and can be achieved within less than a generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the major problems highlighted in the Lancet series is that much of the current research on violence against women has been conducted in high-income countries, and it&#8217;s mostly been focused on response instead of prevention. The study found that the key driver of violence in most middle-and-low income countries is gender inequality, and that it would be near impossible to prevent abuse without addressing the underlying political, economic, and educational marginalization of women.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3598444"></div>
<p>The study also found that health workers are often uniquely positioned to help victims, since they&#8217;re often the first to know about the abuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Health-care providers are often the first point of contact for women and girls experiencing violence,&rdquo; says another series co-lead, Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno, a physician at the WHO, in a statement. &#8220;The health community is missing important opportunities to integrate violence programming meaningfully into public health initiatives on HIV/AIDS, adolescent health, maternal health, and mental health.&#8221;</p>
<p>The series makes five concrete recommendations to curb the violence against women. The authors urge nations to allocate resources to prioritize protecting victims, change structures and policies that discriminate against women, promote support for survivors, strengthen health and education sectors to prevent and respond to violence, and invest in more research into ways to address the problem. In other words: money, education, and political action are key to protecting the world&#8217;s most vulnerable women. <a href="http://time.com/90693/bringbackourgirls-nigeria-boko-haram/" target="_blank">Hashtag activism</a>, celebrity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w7jyVHocTk" target="_blank">songs</a>, and stern <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/1is2many" target="_blank">PSA</a>s are helpful, but this problem is too complicated to be solved by awareness alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now have some promising findings to show what works to prevent violence,&#8221; said Dr. Cathy Zimmerman from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. &#8220;We urgently need to turn this evidence into genuine action so that women and girls can live violence-free lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study comes just in time for the UN&#8217;s <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/endviolenceday/" target="_blank">International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a>, on Nov. 25.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3598444"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

The descriptions on <a href="http://tdor.info/" target="_blank">the website</a> for the occasion, the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance, are chilling: &#8220;massive trauma, found dead in an alley,&#8221; &#8220;murdered and burned,&#8221; &#8220;gunshot to the back.&#8221; Transgender people, particularly transgender women, are subject to high rates of violence and harassment. A <a href="http://www.avp.org/storage/documents/2013_mr_ncavp_hvreport.pdf" target="_blank">2013 report</a> found that 72% of homicide victims in LGBT-related hate crimes were transgender women of color.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://transequality.org/PDFs/Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank">the most definitive report</a> on transgender issues in recent years, 41% of transgender people attempt to commit suicide, a statistic that doesn&#8217;t necessarily factor in successful attempts. That&#8217;s a number that the people behind <a href="http://www.translifeline.org/" target="_blank">Trans Lifeline</a> (877-565-8860), a crisis hotline staffed entirely by transgender people, want to see decreased.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a ton of suicide hotlines. There&rsquo;s no shortage of them,&#8221; says Greta Martela, a software engineer and president of the organization that went live this month. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s really difficult to get a person who isn&rsquo;t trans to understand what it&rsquo;s like to be trans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Empathy is a powerful emotion for people attempting to come to terms with being transgender. Many transgender people say they only had the courage to come out once they met someone else who was living a happy life as an openly transgender person, people <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> actress Laverne Cox calls &#8220;possibility models.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martela came out last year, as a 44-year-old parent. Before she did, she was plagued by anxiety and debilitating panic attacks. In the process of coming out, she called a suicide hotline. A man answered the phone, she says, and when she explained the trouble she was having, he just went quiet and told her to go to the hospital. &#8220;They had no idea how to deal with a trans woman,&#8221; she says. And when she got to the hospital seeking help, she had to explain what being transgender was to the hospital staff.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3598285"></div>
<p>Her aim is to get people in crisis&mdash;whether that person is a suicidal, closeted teenager or the confused parent of a six-year-old&mdash;access to volunteers who can understand what they&#8217;re going through right away and direct them to more help wherever they are. &#8220;Those are the people I want to call the most,&#8221; Martela says of parents who are trying to understand what a child is going through. &#8220;Getting them good resources could spare their child a lifetime of pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, the corporation&mdash;which has applied for status as a non-profit&mdash;is a shoestring operation, fueled by open source software that allows Trans Lifeline to funnel calls to on-duty volunteers wherever they are. They&#8217;re raising funds for advertising to get their number out there, to people like Martela who couldn&#8217;t find anything like the hotline when she needed it. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a body count associated with people not accepting trans people,&#8221; Martela told TIME in a previous interview for <a href="http://time.com/135480/transgender-tipping-point/" target="_blank">a cover story</a> on transgender issues. &#8220;It&rsquo;s costing lives.&rdquo;</p>

Staring off camera, switching positions, silent. In the latest contribution to the Bill Cosby saga, we see husband and wife side by side as he addresses the very act of questioning about his numerous rape allegations in an AP interview (above). Mrs. Cosby continues to smile and looks away from the reporter several times, both she and her husband presuming that the cameras have stopped rolling. I will not read into her silence. I will not pull meaning about this woman and her thoughts and decisions other than to say that in the watching, the silence is palpable, wince-inducing and profoundly painful.</p>

<p class="BodyA">The NPR audio interview released last week showcases Cosby&#8217;s clearly pre-determined response to the softest, almost nervous questions about the rape allegations: deafening silence.</p>
<p class="BodyA">This should not<b> </b>be viewed as the mature response of a well respected, integrity filled man (and in the case of his wife, a beloved, regal woman) attempting to maintain dignity and stay above the fray. It should be seen as what it is: A power move by a someone so arrogant that he thinks he shouldn&#8217;t even be asked about the fact that 15 women are accusing him of a horrific crime.</p>
<p class="BodyA">The silence of those publicly associated with Mr. Cosby is also noticeable, as comedians who revere him and actors and actresses whose careers were made by him avoid addressing the not-new bombshell like the plague.</p>
<p class="BodyA">And even in the most recent AP video, as Mrs. Cosby sits idly by, the central tension between Mr. Cosby and the reporter revolves around him pressuring the journalist into, what? Silence. He calmly yet persistently requests the editing out of his own &#8220;no comment&#8221; response to the reporter&#8217;s request for a statement. Be clear: In the actual interview, Mr. Cosby refused to discuss it, saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t talk about that.&#8221; It is that exchange that he wants scrubbed from the record. He even wants his silence silenced.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3598207"></div>
<p class="BodyA">History teaches us that silence is often the most effective tool of power. It forces others into submission. It attempts to control a narrative. It hides things. And it is often a strategic attempt on the part of the powerful to shame other voices &#8211; the victims, the oppressed, the challengers, the inquisitors &#8211; into a similar silence.</p>
<p class="BodyA">But right now as Missouri police use military tactics and tear gas to force silence upon outraged but peaceful Ferguson protestors and rich executives threaten female reporters who won&#8217;t stop talking with personal attacks pulled from private investigators (see the latest Uber controversy), silence is not ok.</p>
<p class="BodyA">And that is why, despite our national love of Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, silence is not an option. Not for me. Not for his countless fans. Not for a media finally ready to deal with the dirt and thankfully, not for the women who are sharing their painful, private stories. It is time to counter his silence with other forms of power. The power of our common sense to see behind a made-for-TV character. The power of these women to, at the very least,<b> </b>have their voices heard. And the power for all of us to seek truth and justice, however unsettling it may be.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-20141119" target="_blank">The story by </a><em><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-20141119" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a> </em>opens with the following disturbing first hand account by a girl called Jackie, who says she was raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house while two other men watched, just four weeks into her freshman year at UVA in 2012.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shut <em>up,</em>&#8221; she heard a man&#8217;s voice say as a body barreled into her, tripping her backward and sending them both crashing through a low glass table. There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh. For a hopeful moment Jackie wondered if this wasn&#8217;t some collegiate prank. Perhaps at any second someone would flick on the lights and they&#8217;d return to the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grab its motherf&#8212;ing leg,&#8221; she heard a voice say. And that&#8217;s when Jackie knew she was going to be raped.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story is graphic, disturbing, and may be traumatizing for anyone who has experienced a sexual assault. Beyond the horrific account, the story goes on to use Jackie&#8217;s experience, other assaults at UVA, and observations from experts to show the ways in which UVA seems to cover up sexual assault. UVA president Teresa Sullivan denied the school was involved in any cover up of sexual assault, telling <em>Rolling Stone</em>: &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re trying to hide the issue, we&rsquo;re not doing a very good job of it.&rdquo;</p>

For me, <em>The Cosby Show&#8217;s<\/em> legacy is personal. As a kid, the young Huxtables were among the few children on television with faces that looked like mine living well-adjusted upper middle class existences that resembled my own. When I considered my Cosby experience alongside the actor&#8217;s on-screen persona, a doctor and family man who combined life lessons with old-fashioned humor, I intuitively knew that he couldn&#8217;t be a serial rapist.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/timeinterstellarcover.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\"><em>Interstellar<\/em>, Where No Movie Has Gone Before<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547825\/nucor-tries-to-reverse-decline-in-american-steelmaking\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Last Men of Steel<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547828\/review-interstellar-christopher-nolan\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Review: <em>Interstellar\u2019s<\/em> Wonder of Worlds Beyond<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>But eventually emotion gave way to reason. Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>osby Show<\/i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?<\/p>\n<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.<\/p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>harm anyone, even indirectly?<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599978\/cosby-show-reruns-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599394\"><\/div>\n<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son<\/em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596545\/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">silence<\/a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599394\"><\/div><\/aside><aside

The &#8220;I&#8221; is distinct from the &#8220;T&#8221; for transgender people, who are typically born with a biological sex that fits the norm for male or female and then grow up to identify with the opposite gender. Intersex babies are not obviously male or female to begin with, according to society&#8217;s general rules about what one&#8217;s physical characteristics and chromosomal makeup are supposed to signify.<\/p>\n<p>As University of Oregon professor and intersex expert Elizabeth Reis writes in her book <em>Bodies in Doubt<\/em>, &#8220;In the United States and most other places, humans are men or they are women; they may not be neither or both. Yet not all bodies are clearly male or female.&#8221; That <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/ency\/article\/001669.htm\" target=\"_blank\">may mean<\/a> a child has typical female chromosomes and ovaries but external bodies parts of a male. Or it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/ency\/article\/001669.htm\" target=\"_blank\">could mean<\/a> the body parts that a doctor typically looks to when declaring a baby to be a girl or boy are incompletely formed, or ambiguous. Sometimes it&#8217;s clear in the delivery room, sometimes intersex people don&#8217;t become aware of their status until they are teenagers and puberty doesn&#8217;t happen as expected.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599950\"><\/div>\n<p>Performing surgery on an intersex baby is controversial. In South Carolina, the parents of an adopted intersex child are suing a hospital and its employees for surgically assigning &#8220;M.C.&#8217;s&#8221; sex as female at 16-months-old. Now around 10 years old, the child identifies as a boy. &#8220;Genital &#8216;normalizing&#8217; surgery does not create or cement a gender identity; it just takes tissue away that the patient may want later,&#8221; writes the Intersex Society of North America in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.isna.org\/faq\/patient-centered\" target=\"_blank\">their position statement<\/a>. Some in the intersex community choose not to have any medically unnecessary surgeries to change how they were born, even after they are old enough to identify their own gender and sexual orientation.<\/p>\n<p>Though it&#8217;s hard to say exactly how common being intersex is (since it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.isna.org\/faq\/frequency\" target=\"_blank\">debatable<\/a> which people belong under that umbrella term), medical experts say that genital anomalies occur in about 1 in 2,000 babies.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the word <em>hermaphrodite<\/em> is considered insensitive and stigmatizing by many who see it as &#8220;vague, demeaning, and sensationalistic, conjuring mythic images of monsters and freaks,&#8221; as Reis writes. Some parents have also balked at the word <em>intersex<\/em>, pushed by activists in the 1990s, feeling it suggests their child has a third gender and can not be a girl or a boy. In the medical establishment, the wide variety of conditions that might be referred to as <em>intersex<\/em> are typically referred to as <em>disorders of sex development<\/em>. Reis has advocated shifting that to <em>divergence of sex development<\/em>, to avoid the connotations of <em>disorder<\/em>, much as <em>gender identity disorder<\/em> was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dsm5.org\/documents\/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">rebranded <em>gender dysphoria<\/em><\/a> by medical professionals addressing transgender

Who, in their right mind, actually likes dealing with the post office?<\/p>\n<p>A lot of people, it turns out. According to a new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/179519\/americans-rate-postal-service-highest-major-agencies.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication\" target=\"_blank\">Gallup<\/a> survey, 72% of Americans say the U.S. Postal Service is doing an excellent or good job. That puts the USPS ahead of 12 other government agencies, including the FBI, the CDC, NASA and the CIA. And the younger the respondent, the more likely they were to think highly of our much-maligned courier: 81% of 18-to-29-year-olds rated the post office&rsquo;s job as excellent or good, while 65% of those over 65 said the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>So what accounts for the post office&#8217;s surprising popularity? Age, for one.<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3585952\/usps-postmaster-general-patrick-donahoe-retire\/\">The Postmaster General Hangs Up His Mail Bag, With a Parting Shot at Congress<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>As the volume of letters has declined, the USPS has evolved to become as much a courier of packages as it is a way to send and receive first-class mail. In the last few years, the post office has not only expanded its delivery of parcels (it recently began a partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3590662\/usps-amazon-holiday-delivery-sunday-christmas\/\">Amazon to deliver on Sundays<\/a>), but it also often delivers packages for FedEx and UPS in what&#8217;s called &#8220;last mile&#8221; delivery, which are shipments to residents that private carriers don&#8217;t service. That means millennials interact less with the USPS at its worst &#8212; the interminable lines at understaffed post offices &#8212; and more from the comfort of home, where the mailman is the person at the door with their new shoes from Amazon or their iPhone from the Apple store.<\/p>\n<p>The post office is also the one agency that Americans actually see doing its job each day. You see postal employees on their routes. You can see post offices open.

So what do the world&#8217;s richest man&#8217;s kids do with their money? Melinda Gates came to TIME&#8217;s offices to talk about her new focus on women and children and especially on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.familyplanning2020.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">contraceptives<\/a>, but she spilled some secrets about how she tries to get her kids to be purposeful with their money.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, she tries to be true to her values, to articulate them and live them out. Then, they do a lot of volunteering together, at &#8220;whatever tugs at their heartstrings&#8221; says Gates. And of course, they&#8217;ve traveled with her. &#8220;They have that connection I think to the developing world,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They see the difference a flock of chicks makes in a family&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s huge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596976\/10-questions-melinda-gates\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the 10 Questions with Melinda Gates here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Gates has always made a point of getting into the streets and poorer neighborhoods when she travels for meetings and conferences. And sometimes she takes her kids. It&#8217;s there, she says, that she meets mothers who tell her that their biggest struggle is having so many children. Although Gates was raised Catholic, she is heading up an initiative to get family planning information, contraceptives and services to 120 million more women by the year 2020. That includes new technology, better delivery system and a lot of education, including for men.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s similarly rigorous about her home life. Her kids save a third of their allowance and designate a charity they&#8217;d like to give it to. (They can also list donations to charities on their Christmas wish list.) As further incentive, their parents double whatever money they&#8217;ve saved.

Each day we should be thankful for everything we have, but many times we take the simple things in life for granted. Waking up in the morning. Being able to hear, see and smell. Walking, running and jumping. These are all things that can be overlooked in our lives that are not guaranteed. We are all guilty of it, but being able to give thanks to God each day for everything he gives us makes life all the richer.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I am thankful for many things.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>My wife and future mother of my children. I feel blessed to have a strong woman of God to tackle the ups and downs of this world with.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>My family. I thank God for the blessing of two parents, Robert and Jacqueline Griffin, who lead by example and showed me and my sisters, De&#8217;Jon and Jihan, what it means to sacrifice for who and what you love.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I am thankful to have true friends who are there through the good times and the bad, who show true loyalty and support. Time may pass but nothing will change, as we can pick up with the laughter and jokes right where we left off. Friends that keep the mood light and prove that life is great make me thankful each day.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I am thankful for all the teammates I have had throughout my career in sports. The Cherubims from Church League basketball. The Bulldawgs from high school football. The Jack Rabbits from AAU track and field. There is something special about being a part of a team that words can not explain.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I am always thankful for all of my successes, but along with that comes my failures. Without the latter, I would not be able to learn from my mistakes and correct my path to create success. Going through the highs and lows of life has made me the man that I am today, and I am very thankful for that.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Lastly, I am thankful for the promise of a future. I know that God has many blessings in store for my life, and beyond that, I believe that he has life for us after this earth that will be grand beyond our imaginations.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Thanksgiving can mean so many things, but as I think of what I am really thankful for, I know it is so much more than just a holiday. It&#8217;s a reminder to stay grateful for our wonderful lives.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><em>Robert Griffin III is the quarterback for the Washington Redskins.<\/em><\/div>\n<aside

matters to Lina Esco, whose new film <i>Free the Nipple<\/i> tells the story of a group of activists challenging laws by baring their chests in the streets.<\/p>\n<p>For Esco, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about going topless, it&rsquo;s about equality.&rdquo; The movie grew out of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freethenipple.com\/\">real-life campaign <\/a>that questions a country that glorifies violence in the media but <a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/specials\/packages\/article\/0,28804,2053230_2053229_2053225,00.html\">removes a woman <\/a>from a flight for breastfeeding her baby. As one of the fictional activists says in the trailer, &ldquo;Our sexuality has been taken away from us and is essentially being sold back to us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The movement got a jump-start when Miley Cyrus, who has faced plenty of censorship herself, tweeted a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MileyCyrus\/status\/410651500541902848\/photo\/1\">picture of herself<\/a> holding a fake nipple last December, accompanied by the hashtag #freethenipple. It&rsquo;s not lost on Esco that the sensationalism of a bunch of topless women can only help to spread the word about her cause. &ldquo;If I would have made a movie called &lsquo;Equality,&rsquo; and no one was going topless,&rdquo;

Almost 70 million girls worldwide have been married before they turned 18. According to WHO estimates, 30% of women worldwide have experienced partner violence. The researchers said that these problems could only be solved with political action and increased funding, since the violence has continued &#8220;despite increased global attention,&#8221; implying awareness is not enough.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No magic wand will eliminate violence against women and girls,&#8221; series co-lead Charlotte Watts, founding Director of the Gender Violence and Health Centre at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said in a statement. &#8220;But evidence tells us that changes in attitudes and behavior are possible, and can be achieved within less than a generation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One of the major problems highlighted in the Lancet series is that much of the current research on violence against women has been conducted in high-income countries, and it&#8217;s mostly been focused on response instead of prevention. The study found that the key driver of violence in most middle-and-low income countries is gender inequality, and that it would be near impossible to prevent abuse without addressing the underlying political, economic, and educational marginalization of women.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3598444\"><\/div>\n<p>The study also found that health workers are often uniquely positioned to help victims, since they&#8217;re often the first to know about the abuse.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Health-care providers are often the first point of contact for women and girls experiencing violence,&rdquo; says another series co-lead, Dr. Claudia Garcia-Moreno, a physician at the WHO, in a statement. &#8220;The health community is missing important opportunities to integrate violence programming meaningfully into public health initiatives on HIV\/AIDS, adolescent health, maternal health, and mental health.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The series makes five concrete recommendations to curb the violence against women. The authors urge nations to allocate resources to prioritize protecting victims, change structures and policies that discriminate against women, promote support for survivors, strengthen health and education sectors to prevent and respond to violence, and invest in more research into ways to address the problem. In other words: money, education, and political action are key to protecting the world&#8217;s most vulnerable women. <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/90693\/bringbackourgirls-nigeria-boko-haram\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hashtag activism<\/a>, celebrity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-w7jyVHocTk\" target=\"_blank\">songs<\/a>, and stern <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/1is2many\" target=\"_blank\">PSA<\/a>s are helpful, but this problem is too complicated to be solved by awareness alone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We now have some promising findings to show what works to prevent violence,&#8221; said Dr. Cathy Zimmerman from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. &#8220;We urgently need to turn this evidence into genuine action so that women and girls can live violence-free lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The study comes just in time for the UN&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/events\/endviolenceday\/\" target=\"_blank\">International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women<\/a>, on Nov. 25.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3598444\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=New%20Global%20Study%20Calls%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20%E2%80%98Epidemic%E2%80%99%20%7C%20TIME&body=New%20Global%20Study%20Calls%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20%E2%80%98Epidemic%E2%80%99%0A%0AGovernments%20need%20to%20step%20up%20their%20game%20to%20protect%20women%2C%20says%20extensive%20new%20research%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598444%2Flancet-violence-against-women-global%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598444%2Flancet-violence-against-women-global%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f67q&text=Violence%20against%20women%20is%20an%20%22epidemic%2C%22%20says%20new%20study&via=TIME\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598444%2Flancet-violence-against-women-global%2F&title=New+Global+Study+Calls+Violence+Against+Women+%E2%80%98Epidemic%E2%80%99\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3598444\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3598444\/lancet-violence-against-women-global\/\" data-title=\"New Global Study Calls Violence Against Women &amp;#8216;Epidemic&amp;#8217;\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on society, relationships, parenting, sex, psychology, aging, gender, career, women's issues, marriage, love and more"},"tag":{"name":"health","slug":"health","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/health\/"},"tags":"abuse|Africa|domestic violence|Economics|Female Genital Mutilation|health|Lancet|partner violence|politics|public health|Rape|Sexual Violence|violence|violence against women|women","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/female-genital-mutliation.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/female-genital-mutliation.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/female-genital-mutliation.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/female-genital-mutliation.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/female-genital-mutliation.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Siegfried Modola\u2014Reuters","caption":"A Pokot woman holds a razor blade after performing a circumcision on four girls in a village about 80 kilometres from the town of Marigat in Baringo County, Kenya, Oct. 16, 2014.

That&#8217;s a number that the people behind <a href=\"http:\/\/www.translifeline.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Trans Lifeline<\/a> (877-565-8860), a crisis hotline staffed entirely by transgender people, want to see decreased.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a ton of suicide hotlines. There&rsquo;s no shortage of them,&#8221; says Greta Martela, a software engineer and president of the organization that went live this month. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s really difficult to get a person who isn&rsquo;t trans to understand what it&rsquo;s like to be trans.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Empathy is a powerful emotion for people attempting to come to terms with being transgender. Many transgender people say they only had the courage to come out once they met someone else who was living a happy life as an openly transgender person, people <em>Orange Is the New Black<\/em> actress Laverne Cox calls &#8220;possibility models.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Martela came out last year, as a 44-year-old parent. Before she did, she was plagued by anxiety and debilitating panic attacks. In the process of coming out, she called a suicide hotline. A man answered the phone, she says, and when she explained the trouble she was having, he just went quiet and told her to go to the hospital. &#8220;They had no idea how to deal with a trans woman,&#8221; she says. And when she got to the hospital seeking help, she had to explain what being transgender was to the hospital staff.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3598285\"><\/div>\n<p>Her aim is to get people in crisis&mdash;whether that person is a suicidal, closeted teenager or the confused parent of a six-year-old&mdash;access to volunteers who can understand what they&#8217;re going through right away and direct them to more help wherever they are. &#8220;Those are the people I want to call the most,&#8221; Martela says of parents who are trying to understand what a child is going through. &#8220;Getting them good resources could spare their child a lifetime of pain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Right now, the corporation&mdash;which has applied for status as a non-profit&mdash;is a shoestring operation, fueled by open source software that allows Trans Lifeline to funnel calls to on-duty volunteers wherever they are.

Staring off camera, switching positions, silent. In the latest contribution to the Bill Cosby saga, we see husband and wife side by side as he addresses the very act of questioning about his numerous rape allegations in an AP interview (above). Mrs. Cosby continues to smile and looks away from the reporter several times, both she and her husband presuming that the cameras have stopped rolling. I will not read into her silence. I will not pull meaning about this woman and her thoughts and decisions other than to say that in the watching, the silence is palpable, wince-inducing and profoundly painful.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599394\/bill-cosby-accusers-cosby-show-fans\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Ask an Ethicist: Can I Still Watch The Cosby Show?<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3598069\/obama-immigration-lincoln-fdr\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Is Obama Overreaching on Immigration?

At every turn, it is the silence that serves as a proxy for power in the story of Bill Cosby, his alleged sexual deviance and the current downward spiral of public opinion. Silence here, as in most cases, represents the power wielded and power taken by those who are seen as, well, power<i>ful.<\/i><\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">In Cosby&#8217;s story we find accusations of women being silenced for decades by threats, lawyers, fear and a generally defensive public, who until now were uninterested in being awakened from sweet dreams of their TV father.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">The NPR audio interview released last week showcases Cosby&#8217;s clearly pre-determined response to the softest, almost nervous questions about the rape allegations: deafening silence.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">This should not<b> <\/b>be viewed as the mature response of a well respected, integrity filled man (and in the case of his wife, a beloved, regal woman) attempting to maintain dignity and stay above the fray. It should be seen as what it is: A power move by a someone so arrogant that he thinks he shouldn&#8217;t even be asked about the fact that 15 women are accusing him of a horrific crime.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">The silence of those publicly associated with Mr. Cosby is also noticeable, as comedians who revere him and actors and actresses whose careers were made by him avoid addressing the not-new bombshell like the plague.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">And even in the most recent AP video, as Mrs. Cosby sits idly by, the central tension between Mr. Cosby and the reporter revolves around him pressuring the journalist into, what? Silence. He calmly yet persistently requests the editing out of his own &#8220;no comment&#8221; response to the reporter&#8217;s request for a statement. Be clear: In the actual interview, Mr. Cosby refused to discuss it, saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t talk about that.&#8221; It is that exchange that he wants scrubbed from the record. He even wants his silence silenced.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3598207\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">History teaches us that silence is often the most effective tool of power. It forces others into submission. It attempts to control a narrative. It hides things. And it is often a strategic attempt on the part of the powerful to shame other voices &#8211; the victims, the oppressed, the challengers, the inquisitors &#8211; into a similar silence.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">But right now as Missouri police use military tactics and tear gas to force silence upon outraged but peaceful Ferguson protestors and rich executives threaten female reporters who won&#8217;t stop talking with personal attacks pulled from private investigators (see the latest Uber controversy), silence is not ok.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\">And that is why, despite our national love of Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, silence is not an option. Not for me. Not for his countless fans. Not for a media finally ready to deal with the dirt and thankfully, not for the women who are sharing their painful, private stories. It is time to counter his silence with other forms of power. The power of our common sense to see behind a made-for-TV character. The power of these women to, at the very least,<b> <\/b>have their voices heard. And the power for all of us to seek truth and justice, however unsettling it may be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><div class=\"newsletter-shortcode the-brief\">\n<form

href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/features\/a-rape-on-campus-20141119\" target=\"_blank\">Rolling Stone<\/a> <\/em>opens with the following disturbing first hand account by a girl called Jackie, who says she was raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house while two other men watched, just four weeks into her freshman year at UVA in 2012.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shut <em>up,<\/em>&#8221; she heard a man&#8217;s voice say as a body barreled into her, tripping her backward and sending them both crashing through a low glass table. There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh. For a hopeful moment Jackie wondered if this wasn&#8217;t some collegiate prank. Perhaps at any second someone would flick on the lights and they&#8217;d return to the party.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Grab its motherf&#8212;ing leg,&#8221; she heard a voice say. And that&#8217;s when Jackie knew she was going to be raped.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The story is graphic, disturbing, and may be traumatizing for anyone who has experienced a sexual assault. Beyond the horrific account, the story goes on to use Jackie&#8217;s experience, other assaults at UVA, and observations from experts to show the ways in which UVA seems to cover up sexual assault. UVA president Teresa Sullivan denied the school was involved in any cover up of sexual assault, telling <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>: &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re trying to hide the issue, we&rsquo;re not doing a
