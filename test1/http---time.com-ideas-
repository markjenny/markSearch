But the results, published online today in the<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, show that <strong>the mobile phone data were better at predicting friendship than the subjects themselves.</strong> Thirty-two pairs of subjects switched from calling each other acquaintances to friends in the traditionally gathered survey data. These are most likely new relationships that formed during the course of the study, say the researchers, and they left a clear signal in the mobile phone data. Friends call each other far more often than acquaintances do when they are off-campus and during weekends. <strong>The pattern is so distinct that the researchers spotted budding friendships in the phone data months before the people themselves called themselves friends.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s another great <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704547604576263261679848814.html" target="_blank">article</a> in the WSJ by Robert Lee Hotz about how scientists are using phone data to study our behavior &mdash; and learning more than they ever thought they could:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&hellip;at MIT, scientists who tracked student cellphones during the latest presidential election were able to deduce that two people were talking about politics, even though the researchers didn&rsquo;t know the content of the conversation. By analyzing changes in movement and communication patterns, researchers could also detect flu symptoms before the students themselves realized they were getting sick.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Phones can know,&rdquo; said Dr. Pentland, director of MIT&rsquo;s Human Dynamics Laboratory, who helped pioneer the research. &ldquo;People can get this god&rsquo;s-eye view of human behavior.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, companies are very interested in this data:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cellphone providers are openly exploring other possibilities. <strong>By mining their calling records for social relationships among customers, several European telephone companies discovered that people were five times more likely to switch carriers if a friend had already switched, said Mr. Eagle, who works with the firms. The companies now selectively target people for special advertising based on friendships with people who dropped the service.</strong></p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3600178"></div></blockquote>
<p>And some of the results are downright unnerving:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>After analyzing more than 16 million records of call date, time and position, the researchers determined that, taken together, people&rsquo;s movements appeared to follow a mathematical pattern.</strong> <em><strong>The scientists said that, with enough information about past movements, they could forecast someone&rsquo;s future whereabouts with 93.6% accuracy.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>The pattern held true whether people stayed close to home or traveled widely, and wasn&rsquo;t affected by the phone user&rsquo;s age or gender.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A few other interesting tidbits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall, our phones <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/does-technology-make-us-more-or-less-happy" target="_blank">make us happier</a>. (There&rsquo;s even <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/can-your-iphone-increase-your-happiness" target="_blank">an app for that</a>.)</li>
<li>They may be making us more selfish, however. Our phones can fulfill our need for human contact, <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/is-your-cellphone-making-you-more-selfish" target="_blank">making us less inclined to go out of our way to help others</a>.</li>
<li>These devices can distract us so much we don&rsquo;t notice the world around us &mdash; <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/can-your-cellphone-distract-you-so-much-you-d" target="_blank">even if it contains unicycling clowns</a>. (To be fair, people may actually <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/do-people-like-us-better-when-were-distracted" target="_blank">like us better when we are distracted during a conversation</a>.)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve become so addicted to our phones that two-thirds of users report hearing &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/do-frequent-cell-phone-users-experience-phant" target="_blank">phantom ringing</a>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>We rely so much on these devices that <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/how-many-people-cant-remember-their-home-phon" target="_blank">a third of people under 30 can&rsquo;t remember their home phone numbers</a> &mdash; if they have one at all.</li>
<li>5% of relationships were <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/little-known-statistics-on-sex-and-relationsh" target="_blank">ended by text message</a>. People even get <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/do-people-ever-get-divorced-via-text-message" target="_blank">divorced via text</a>. (<a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/are-iphone-users-more-promiscuous" target="_blank">iPhone users are more promiscuous</a>, by the way.)</li>
<li>By stripping away the emotional information in faces and intonation, text messaging might be <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/does-technology-make-us-autistic" target="_blank">simulating autism</a>.</li>
<li>That said, text message reminders have effectively <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/can-text-messages-make-you-healthier-and-rich" target="_blank">encouraged s</a><a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/can-text-messages-make-you-healthier-and-rich" target="_blank">aving, reduced smoking</a> and <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/how-can-you-easily-get-more-people-to-vote" target="_blank">increased voting</a>.</li>

Twelve pieces are on display right now at the Kreeger Museum in Washington, D.C., including my all-time favorite, &#8220;Lament.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the road started early for me. Telling stories. Communicating a message. Developing my voice in this evolving medium over the course of more than two decades. Sometimes there is no way to take a different path when it is what you love &mdash; even when it doesn&#8217;t love you back.</p>
<p>I trudged through 10 years in local news, worked overnights at CBS News for four years, hosted a cable show for women for two years after that until finally settling into what I thought would be a life-long career as a correspondent for CBS News. My first week on the job was 9/11. I traveled America finding stories for &#8220;The CBS Evening News,&#8221; &#8220;CBS Sunday Morning,&#8221; even &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; Anchoring the CBS Evening News Sunday edition felt like a feather in my cap.</p>
<p>Just shy of my 40th birthday, the road ended. I was called down to the office of the President of CBS News and was told, &#8220;They were moving in a different direction.&#8221; I was being fired. I. Was. Fired. They liked my work&hellip; but didn&#8217;t like it anymore&hellip; or just had other people coming in&#8230; Whatever it was, my days at CBS News had abruptly come to an end.</p>
<p>Being fired is an out-of-body experience. I remember it like it was yesterday. A mixture of anger, feeling victimized, feeling exhilarated and free, and feeling scared shitless all at once. But then the time starts to pass, and if you are like I was, the NEXT job couldn&#8217;t come soon enough.</p>
<p>I sent my work to other networks and the response was&hellip; crickets. I went from everything to everyone to nothing to no one. If I did get an interview, the first question was: Why were you fired? I didn&#8217;t have an answer because I didn&#8217;t really know. Each job interview set me deeper back; deeper into knowing it was over. It&#8217;s hard to fight nothing. No phone ringing. No calls back. Just &#8220;No thank you,&#8221; from everywhere I applied. I would re-apply six months later. Nothing.</p>
<p>I did get an audition to anchor the local news at the ABC affiliate in Washington. I was told I was close&#8230; down to three. I went for the audition and was desperate for the job. So desperate it was written all over my face. They gave it to the talented Alison Starling who is still there to this day.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3600691"></div>
<p>At about nine months of nothing, with severance running out, I knew I had to find another road. I began the task of applying for any job anywhere. I was overqualified for many jobs I applied for online, but still got no calls. Slowly&#8230; ever so slowly, I got responses from a few major PR firms. One, just one, called me in for an interview. I had the skills and the experience to do PR well.</p>
<p>It was at this time that a good friend &mdash; a talented producer at CBS News &mdash; was in the process of getter fired too (or &#8220;released from her contract&#8221;). The turnover was continuing there and this time, it was my friend&#8217;s turn. Since I had been through it, I was coaching her through the process &mdash; the hurt, the anger, the loss, the fear. I was reliving it all with her. Knowing the place and the players, it really was like my loss all over again. She was one of the best producers there and had taught me everything I know about voice control, studio tracking and storytelling.</p>
<p>My job interview turned into another one until it was down to a final round. A job as a VP at a major PR firm. Real money. It was the kind of money that would keep the family moving forward. We were at a dead stop with no hope in sight. This job was a potential lifeline&hellip; right there for the taking.</p>
<p>I was waiting for the call to line up the last round. I&#8217;ll never forget the moment. Driving my pickup up the hill near my house, the &#8217;93 Ford 150 with roll-up windows just stopped&hellip; Stalled out and died. I knew that meant another $500 at the shop. $500 that I did not have. Then my cell phone rings. It&#8217;s the PR firm. Wanting to know if I can come in this week&hellip;</p>
<p>I put the truck in park in the middle of the road and listened to myself as I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to come in but I have to be honest; I know someone better for the job. Perfect actually.&#8221; I then began to sing the praises of my soon-to-be fired friend. It came out of my mouth as if I had been practicing it forever&hellip; So easy to say, because it was true. She was perfect for the job, and I was not. I knew this road, as much as I needed one, would not be taken by me.</p>
<p>I remember clunking my head on the steering wheel after I hung up asking myself: &#8220;Why, WHY?? You need a job so badly!&#8221; But I knew it even then. There was still only one road for me&hellip; and that this one wasn&#8217;t it. I knew even then I would have to find my way back to that road I chose at 13 years old. Somehow.</p>
<p>It took many more months, but I called every network known to man and begged for ANY job they had available. I found myself LEAPING at the opportunity to work a day rate, part-time, freelance job at MSNBC reading 30 second news cut-ins &mdash; a job I probably would have scoffed at 15 years prior.</p>
<p>Eight weeks into working the &#8220;cut-in shift&#8221; at MSNBC, Don Imus was knocked off the air for making unfortunate comments. MSNBC was on the hunt for a new morning show&hellip;</p>
<p>I was back on the road again.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3600691"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

<p class="ng-scope">Being a Black person at an HBCU is nothing short of divine. A community of academics who understand you, instructors who are exceptionally hard on you because they know what you&rsquo;re up against in this world, and an ever-present aura that dispels every negative thing that you were taught about your color from the moment you knew what it was.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">I chopped off my chemically processed hair, took every class I could led by the master of Africana Studies, Dr. Gregory Carr, and wore an ankh on my body every chance I got.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Needless to say, I only dated Black men.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Though I find Black men physically attractive, what I really, really find attractive is the unspoken understanding that exists between me and a Black man of my choosing. I love not explaining why I tie my hair up at night, or that my skin would burn in beach sun without sunblock. I love arguing about whether &ldquo;Love Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love and Basketball&rdquo; was the greatest Black love story of the &rsquo;90s. I could never date outside of Black men, I thought. It would never work.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">But I was W-R-O-N-G! I could and I did.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">We&rsquo;ll call him Mazzi for discretion&rsquo;s sake. He stood about 6 feet and 5 inches. He was handsome, funny, and a bit cynical. We worked in the same space, after I had graduated from college, for about a year. I hardly noticed him at the onset but eventually we began talking and sharing inside jokes and such. And one day he asked me on a date.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">There was naturally some apprehension: 1) because we worked together AND 2) because he was unquestionably a white man.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">I expressed my desire to keep it quiet at work and Mazzi agreed, so we went.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">I laughed a lot that evening. Like from pick-up to drop-off. As our dates went on for some months, I began to notice the disapproving eyes of people around us when we were out together.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">&ldquo;Do you see how people look at us?!&rdquo; I asked one day.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said nonchalantly. &ldquo;It happens all the time. People don&rsquo;t have shit going on in their own lives so that fact that I&rsquo;m here with this &lsquo;self-aware&rsquo; Black woman is earth shattering to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="ng-scope">I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He smiled cautiously.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Time passed and we grew closer. I had just gotten into running and he was a thrower for his college&rsquo;s track team so he would offer me advice on what I can do to get faster and stronger (he also gave awesome back rubs). He was a writer who never put his thoughts down and I encouraged him to do so. He had become my sounding board when I would get overwhelmed and met disappointments in my medical school application process, and I was his &ldquo;therapist&rdquo; who eventually got to the root of his cynicism. We were comfortable with one another. At some point in all this, I changed jobs to work in my field and we no longer had the &ldquo;work thing&rdquo; to consider.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3600604"></div>
<p class="ng-scope">Here I was: Ms. HBCU, Afro-turned locs sporting, ankh wearing, and lover of all things Black &mdash; falling for a white man.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">He brought up the subject of a relationship and I retreated. I&rsquo;d talk about my reluctance to get in relationships (which was true) and he didn&rsquo;t push the issue. But of course eventually I entered a relationship with him because it only made sense.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">My two closest friends were shocked but very supportive and liked him a lot. I liked him too. He was the ideal, except he wasn&rsquo;t Black.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">My family slowly began to pick up on the fact that this was more than a collection of dates and did not necessarily approve. This didn&rsquo;t impact me so much though. I was good at being rebellious.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">His family was really sweet to me and always invited and included me when going to dinners or family parties.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Though I never felt &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; throughout the course of our relationship, race was an issue.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">I remember the first time it was brought to my attention. He was driving and talking to me on the phone with some friends in the car. His friends had been drinking one of them yelled into the phone.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">&ldquo;Tell Ashley I miss her! Wait! Do Black people miss people?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Now you and I both know how idiotic of a statement that was, but my issue was not with his asshole of a friend, it was with his lack of response to the comment. He later told me he addressed it. I didn&rsquo;t believe him.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">When I would experience &ldquo;exotic otherness&rdquo; at work, I would talk to him about it and he would suggest that I was overreacting when I knew I wasn&rsquo;t. He would never know the feeling I was describing and I really couldn&rsquo;t<a href="http://www.xojane.com/issues/white-privilege-ferguson"> expect him to understand</a>.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Then once in an argument, he said that my beloved alma mater was &ldquo;institutionally racist.&rdquo; This was a HUGE mistake on his part. I don&rsquo;t remember my exact response but I am certain it was angry.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">These were tough issues we had to work through. And it was hard. In considering a future with him, I worried about these issues. And he got to a point where he would refuse to talk if he sensed that race would come up. I understood, it was tense between us.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">But when it was good, which usually was the case, it was perfect. Then, during a period that I thought was a good one, he went through my phone while I was sleeping. He read messages between my friends and me about how I missed the comfort and familiarity of Black men&#8230; OUCH!</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Race was an issue.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">To know me is to know that a violation of my privacy is grounds for dismissal. I felt guilty, so I didn&rsquo;t break up with him right way. But from that point forward, I stopped feeling like myself. I was no longer mentally present in the relationship and I strongly resented the phone incident. The race thing was too hard and I had stopped &ldquo;trying&rdquo; because I knew he didn&rsquo;t trust me anyway. I ended it a few months later.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">This was in August. And I would be fooling myself if I said I don&rsquo;t sometimes think I made a mistake. In my relationship, I felt special, and I was loved &mdash; even though he wasn&rsquo;t Black.</p>
<p class="ng-scope">Someone made a comment to me recently: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came back to this side.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I never changed,&rdquo; because though Mazzi may not have been the guy for me, and though he was undoubtedly a white man, he never wanted anything from me, but me &mdash; locs and all.</p>

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.</p>
<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?</p>
<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/19/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime/" target="_blank">decided there was not sufficient evidence</a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.</p>
<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde/">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde</a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.</p>
<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599631"></div>
<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know</em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?</p>
<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.</p>
<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission. That is never an acceptable decision for the chronicler of somebody else&rsquo;s life.</p>

Making that call is a moral calculus: when do the negative aspects of a public figure outweigh the positive? Granted, in Bill Cosby&#8217;s case, we&#8217;re talking about a comedian, but the question is relevant for <em>The Cosby Show</em>&#8216;s legacy. Should I think less of <i>The Cosby Show</i>&#8216;s power to teach and to change perceptions of race in America if it turns out Bill Cosby is a rapist?</p>

For me, <em>The Cosby Show&#8217;s</em> legacy is personal. As a kid, the young Huxtables were among the few children on television with faces that looked like mine living well-adjusted upper middle class existences that resembled my own. When I considered my Cosby experience alongside the actor&#8217;s on-screen persona, a doctor and family man who combined life lessons with old-fashioned humor, I intuitively knew that he couldn&#8217;t be a serial rapist.</p>

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The </i><i>C</i><i>osby Show</i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?</p>
<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show </i>harm anyone, even indirectly?</p>
<p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href="http://time.com/3599978/cosby-show-reruns-rape/" target="_blank">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show</em>?</a>)</p>
<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599394"></div>
<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.</p>
<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show</em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son</em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.</p>
<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show </i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href="http://time.com/3596545/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video/" target="_blank">silence</a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3599394"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

It can take months, sometimes longer to find a good job, especially if I try to change careers. And I doubt anyone wants to hire a newbie at anywhere near my salary.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> But, God, I don&#8217;t want to stay at Western Widget Works, Inc. forever.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> No, but I worry that after all that job hunting, I won&#8217;t even like my new job or career any better.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> I need to remember that I don&#8217;t have to take that new job. I just need to take a little time to see if I can find something better. If not, I&#8217;ll stay put. I&#8217;ll just start networking.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> But I hate networking and I&#8217;m lousy at it. I just don&#8217;t make a good first impression, no matter how much I practice. I&#8217;m better off spending the time improving my skills: tech stuff, public speaking.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> Okay, maybe I should do that, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I shouldn&#8217;t be looking for a job. If I don&#8217;t want to network, I&#8217;ll just answer some on-target ads, one a week.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> But if that&#8217;s all I do, a year or two from now, I&#8217;ll probably still be at Western Widget. Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> So, fine. I&#8217;ll apply to three jobs a week.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> But every job opening gets so many applications.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> I really have to make mine better&mdash;Write a cover letter that, point by point, explains how I meet the job&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> But if I&#8217;m changing careers, I won&#8217;t be meeting most of the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> Okay, then I&#8217;ll include a white paper, like a term paper, on a topic related to the new job that would interest that employer. That will show current chops and interest, and a concrete work sample.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> But that will take a ton of time.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> No it won&#8217;t. A few-page white paper is like one of those papers I wrote in college. One day I knew nothing about the topic and two days later, I knew a lot and cranked out a good paper.I need to stop complaining. It&#8217;s better than staying at Western Widget. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> Maybe. What if the problem isn&#8217;t the job but me? If I&#8217;m honest with myself, as I look back on all my jobs, I&#8217;ve always struggled.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> Do I have to face that I&#8217;m not the sharpest tool in the shed?</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3600213"></div>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> That may be part of it. I know that I can&#8217;t seem to make myself consistently care enough about work. I do my job but I can&#8217;t seem to maintain the fire in my belly. I&#8217;m not sure I can change that.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> So maybe I need to downscale my job aspirations. Up isn&#8217;t the only way. I fought my way to be a manager, but maybe I&#8217;d be happier and more successful if I did something less demanding.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> Am I the poster boy for the Peter Principle, rising to my level of incompetence?</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> Maybe. I&#8217;ve always tried to compete with my high-achieving friends. Isn&#8217;t that silly? Maybe by trying to be what I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m making myself miserable and ensuring I don&#8217;t succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> But what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> Maybe I should go back to being an individual contributor or a support person. I&#8217;m organized and good at details. Maybe I should go back to being a coordinator, a marketing coordinator. Maybe I should talk with my boss or HR about getting that kind of job at Western Widget?</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> Actually, I don&#8217;t give a crap about marketing widgets.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> I need to remember that as long as the widget is worth marketing, it&#8217;s worth doing.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> Stop with the pious preaching.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> How sure am I that I&#8217;ll care more about work if I were doing something else? I say I care about gifted kids being ignored in today&#8217;s elementary schools but would I really, after a honeymoon period, be that much more motivated to work hard on some job related to that, or will my laziness come along with me wherever I go?</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> I don&#8217;t want to think I&#8217;m doomed to mediocrity. I can&#8217;t be sure whether I&#8217;ll be any happier on behalf of gifted kids but maybe I should try.</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> That&#8217;s probably right. I should volunteer a few hours a week at some school with a lot of bright kids or maybe even for a school district&#8217;s director of programs for the gifted. I should do a little networking, make the case that my skills in marketing and being organized and detail oriented would be valuable there. I should apply to jobs anywhere I might be willing to live that excite me. If I get hired, fine. And if not, I&#8217;ll feel better for having tried. And who knows? In spending time around those people quite different from those at Western Widget, I may learn about something or about myself that I wouldn&#8217;t know if I just kept on keeping on with my same-old routine.</p>
<p><strong>Alter ego:</strong> I&#8217;ll think about it.</p>

The re-examination of rape accusations against Bill Cosby that Hannibal Buress &mdash; and a growing number of women subsequently coming forward with their stories &mdash; helped trigger has changed a lot, fast. A story that had largely lain buried for years is suddenly everywhere. And that has apparently ended Cosby&#8217;s late-career comeback: NBC quashed an in-development Cosby sitcom, while Netflix pulled a standup special planned to air the day after Thanksgiving.</p>

But as Buress suggested, the cultural stakes are not about Cosby&#8217;s future &mdash; they&#8217;re about his past, his legacy. On the one hand, the public is hearing that a beloved entertainer has been accused of using his power to sexually prey on women for decades. On the other, that entertainer created a long-running TV show that was a landmark not just of entertainment but of American society.</p>
<p><em>The Cosby Show</em> is part of our history; it can&#8217;t be erased. (Even if TV Land has pulled its reruns.) It&#8217;s funny, insightful, moving, great. But it is now also &mdash; whatever you think of the allegations and the real-world consequences &mdash; <em>weird</em>, in a way that&#8217;s hard to shake.</p>
<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m not asking here whether it&#8217;s &#8220;OK&#8221; to watch <em>The Cosby Show</em>. The moral question of whether to support an artist financially is a different one (and, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/11/21/7257417/bill-cosby-show" target="_blank">as Todd van der Werff points out at Vox</a>, whether or not you watch reruns will make very little difference to Cosby&#8217;s bottom line now). I don&#8217;t want to police that call, and if we ejected every questionable artist from the canon &mdash; abusers, bigots, reprobates &mdash; our bookshelves and movie queues would be a lot lighter.</p>
<p>But it seems hard to hear what we&#8217;ve been hearing and not feel <em>anything</em> different when watching Cliff Huxtable making faces and dispensing wisdom. &#8220;Innocent until proven guilty&#8221; is a standard for the courts, for good reason. But it&#8217;s not a standard for life. If what you know or hear about an artist affects the way you see their work, you can no more will yourself to feel otherwise than you can force yourself not to blink.</p>
<p>Of course, bad people can create great works. People are complicated. Art is complicated. And so is the question of whether you can <a href="http://time.com/682/bad-deeds-dont-ruin-great-art/" target="_blank">separate the art from the artist</a> &mdash; the answer is different for every creator and every audience member. Whatever you think of the disturbing allegations against Woody Allen, for instance, there&#8217;s a good argument that although his movies have often relied on his persona, they don&#8217;t depend on your considering him a morally upstanding person. (Even if some, like <em>Crimes and Misdemeanors</em>, turn on issues of morality.)</p>
<p>With <em>The Cosby Show</em>, though, Bill Cosby the person is throughly and intentionally baked into it&mdash; his identity, his persona, his claimed authority. It&#8217;s not a show made as if it <em>wants</em> us to separate the art from the artist, and not just because &#8220;Cosby&#8221; is in the name.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599978"></div>
<p>Cliff Huxtable isn&#8217;t &mdash; like &#8220;Jerry Seinfeld&#8221; in <em>Seinfeld &mdash; </em>a carbon copy of his creator. But Cosby invested himself in Cliff in ways that were deeper and more binding. He drew on his own life, patterning Theo&#8217;s struggles in school, for instance, on his own son Ennis&#8217; diagnosis of dyslexia. Cliff and the show shared Cosby&#8217;s interests in African American high culture, especially jazz.</p>
<p>Cliff liked what Cosby liked, felt what he felt, argued what he argued. He may have had a different job, but more important, he had Cosby&#8217;s sensibility and sense of didactic purpose. As Mark Whitaker pointed out in his biography &mdash; which ignored the rape accusations but delved deep into Cosby&#8217;s creative life &mdash; the comedian mingled his real and fictional lives so thoroughly that during the first season that &#8220;the producers and director started to notice something telling. When they were discussing scripts, he would sometimes slip and refer to his character as Bill instead of Cliff.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was part of the power of <em>The Cosby Show</em>: people&#8217;s affection for Cosby transferred to Cliff, and their respect for Cliff rebounded to Cosby (who at the height of the show&#8217;s popularity wrote the best-selling <em>Fatherhood</em>). Everything about this relationship between artist and creation said: <em>Cliff speaks for me</em>. And what Cliff had to say was also, deliberately, instructive: about how parents should speak to children, how white Americans should see their African American neighbors, how men should regard women. (See, for instance, the running jokes spoofing the clueless chauvinism of Sondra&#8217;s husband Elvin.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve rewatched those episodes a lot lately, especially in the last few years as my kids have discovered the reruns on Hulu. They&#8217;re still funny and powerful. They stand up, and they stand on their own. But they&#8217;re also designed to work, in part, by drawing on the moral authority of Cliff and, by extension, Cosby.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t erase <em>The Cosby Show</em>&#8216;s place in TV history &mdash; the way it changed comedy, <a href="http://flavorwire.com/489681/the-cosby-show-is-too-important-to-erase-from-tv-history" target="_blank">represented the unrepresented</a> and reframed African Americans in pop culture &mdash; even if it were possible to do so. No one owes it to the rest of the world to stop liking <em>The Cosby Show</em>. But it&#8217;s also understandable if, this time, you can&#8217;t easily &#8220;separate the art from the artist,&#8221; when the artist worked so hard and so effectively, for so long, to meld them together.</p>
<p><em>The Cosby Show</em> is a great, important, transformational piece of American culture. Nothing Bill Cosby does or has done in real life can ever change that; nor can that ever excuse anything Bill Cosby does or has done in real life.</p>
<p>But will it ever, entirely not be weird? There is no statute of limitations on that.</p>

She also recorded a robocall asking that the people of Fayetteville, Arkansas, vote to repeal a law that stops discrimination based on gender identity. Basically she wants people to be able to discriminate against transgender men and women.</p>
<p>Now some people think that we need to silence the Duggars and those like them. I think we should let them keep going. Nothing defeats complacency like knowing exactly where gay people stand with millions of Americans. Now, it&rsquo;s not a shock that the overly religious Duggars don&rsquo;t like gay people. That&rsquo;s sort of like saying that Paula Deen likes butter. But, when gay marriage is passing in state after state, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that not everyone is on the bandwagon. There are still large groups of Americans out there who want to rob us of our rights, and if we don&rsquo;t stay vigilant, we&rsquo;ll never win the war.</p>
<p>Right now we&rsquo;re having a bit of success in dealing with pop culture homophobes. In May, HGTV decided to cancel a show they were planning to air featuring David and Jason Benham when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/08/showbiz/tv/benham-brothers-hgtv/">it was discovered</a> that they had made some nasty comments about gay people very publicly.</p>
<p>Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty made some <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson">very homophobic comments to <em>GQ</em></a> this January, and <a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/23/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson-antigay-sermon-video/">was mouthing off once again</a> this May about how gay sex is unnatural. He was suspended from A&amp;E briefly for his behavior and the ratings for the show <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/duck-dynasty-ratings-fall-even-further-in-second-episode-after-robertson-controversy/">tanked after his disclosure</a>.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599721"></div>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need these people to keep talking. There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that there is hatred in the hearts of many people for LGBTQ men and women in this country, but if that hatred just stays in their hearts they&rsquo;ll be working against us without our knowledge. The louder they become, the easier it is to target them. And when we can target them, well, we&rsquo;ve seen that we can do things to shut them up. If only we could give them all a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS91gT3XT_A">pie in the face</a> like Anita Bryant got.</p>
<p>Having loudmouth opponents also serves as an effective recruiting tool for allies to gay civil rights causes. Like it or not, reality stars like the Duggars and especially the Robertsons&ndash;whose most recent season finale still clocked almost <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/duck-dynasty-finale-ratings-drop-from-season-5-ender/" target="_blank">4 million viewers</a>&ndash;have a huge stage. When they make these sorts of remarks there is always a media firestorm and each time that happens, I would like to think that there is at least one fan out there who thinks, &ldquo;God, what an idiot.&rdquo; Hopefully that opens up some minds and shows those out there who may not be very hospitable to the &ldquo;gay lifestyle&rdquo; that bigotry is distasteful no matter how it manifests itself.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get to teach these lessons, show our strength or fight these battles if these people are silent. We need people like Michelle Duggar to be loud in order to get the hard work of activism done. So no matter how much it sucks, we have to just take it on the chin every time one of these yahoos has the bright idea to spout off. Trust me, it&rsquo;s for the greater good. Every time a reality star says something ignorant about the LGBT community, a gay angel gets her wings.</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde, one of the world&rsquo;s most public and tragic gay men, said &ldquo;True friends stab you in the front.&rdquo; There is no doubt in my mind that there are plenty of misinformed people in America carrying daggers against gay people, including those who have a public forum to discuss those views. Why would we want them hiding that hatred in the shadows when, out in the open, it can be diffused, acted on and used as a teaching tool to get more people on our side. We should all thank Michelle Duggar. She thinks that she&rsquo;s stabbing gay Americans in the front, but what she&rsquo;s really doing is bloodying herself.</p>

This seam in his past has been aired quite often over the past 10 years, and yet his iconic status as America&rsquo;s favorite (black) Dad has continued, with NBC having even been readying to build yet another sitcom around him until this Wednesday.

<p>For one, Cosby has alienated many black people with his criticisms of black behavior, crystallized in the now famous &ldquo;Pound Cake speech&rdquo; of 2004 commemorating <em>Brown v. the Board of Education</em>. When black comedian Hannibal Buress <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2014/10/hannibal-buress-called-bill-cosby-a-rapist.html" target="_blank">charged</a> that Cosby is a racist, sparking the latest events when the clip went viral, Buress was explicit that it rankles him that Cosby has called for black people to &ldquo;Pull your pants up,&rdquo; etc. when Cosby himself had, shall we say, not done so.</p>
<p>Yet, the dirt on Cosby had been aired far and wide soon after the Pound Cake speech, with black author and pundit Michael Eric Dyson even covering the territory in his 2005 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bill-Cosby-Right-Black-Middle/dp/0465017207/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416532330&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=is+bill+cosby+right">book</a>, a broadside against Cosby&rsquo;s cultural opinions. Newsweek, The Today Show, People, and other sources chimed in around the same time. No one remotely interested in Cosby could have missed the charges, and while today Twitter and Facebook get things around especially quickly, by 2005 and 2006 broadband and blogs were already influencing opinion at a dizzying rate. Irritation over Cosby&rsquo;s views alone, then, did not threaten his iconic status &mdash; especially given that more black people than often acknowledged actually concur with Cosby&rsquo;s cultural opinions.</p>
<p>The second factor in why Cosby has been outed now &mdash; one that is key, but not decisive &mdash; is that sexual violation of women has been so widely discussed in America over the past few years. The &ldquo;legitimate rape&rdquo; conceptions of congressman Todd Akin and today&rsquo;s calls for universities to address the frequency of rape on their campuses have made it much less likely that Cosby&rsquo;s behavior could be given a pass.</p>
<p>But even this doesn&rsquo;t fully answer the &ldquo;Why now?&rdquo; question. Enlightened American sensibilities about rape have not taken a quantum leap since, say, 2005. The major dividing line for that would be in the early &#8217;90s, when sexual harassment and date rape entered mainstream discussion and forever banished the old-time Mad Men idea that such things were a mere matter of some men being &ldquo;all hands.&rdquo; Who by 2005, upon hearing about what Cosby did, was thinking &ldquo;Oh well, boys will be boys!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>We get closer to truth in Rebecca Traister&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120338/bill-cosby-rape-allegations-why-america-took-so-long-wake">point</a> that America has been afraid to condemn Cosby out of a sense that it would be almost sacrilegious to pull down such an iconic representation of blackness. More specifically, whites have given him a pass out of a sense that it would be racist not to, while blacks have been reluctant to assist in the defrocking of such a beloved figure, chary of aiding and abetting whites in racist dismissal of black achievement and authority.</p>
<p>What has made the difference is that certain happenings of late have let America make a particular kind of post-Civil Rights adjustment: getting past the polite fiction that all criticisms of a black person are racist, and if not overtly then &ldquo;on a certain level.&rdquo;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599400"></div>
<p>Namely here is where Cain and Obama come in. The implosion of Herman Cain&rsquo;s quest for the Republican nomination in 2011 in the wake of charges (from white women) of sexual harassment and infidelity was a handy transition. Cain&rsquo;s Republican politics and jolly dismissal of traditional Civil Rights positions meant that few blacks were primed to dismiss the accusations against him as racist, as a &ldquo;lynching,&rdquo; and so on. Instead, we simply saw Cain as a man brought down for proper reasons, his color beside the point.</p>
<p>It probably had to be a black Republican that this happened to. But since then, a consensus has settled in on the question as to how much of a part racism plays in the animus of those who dislike President Obama. And the verdict is: racism does play some part. But still, only ideologues think racism is the only reason, or even close to the only reason, someone might not be crazy about Obama&rsquo;s performance in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>At best, Obama is likely to go down as having been an OK President, and in grappling with that, Blue America has gotten a quiet lesson in evaluating black people according to the content of their character &mdash; despite having thought they already did that by voting for him in the first place.</p>
<p>Hence a moment when it is newly easy to see Cosby not as a Black Gentleman With Some Issues but as a man, period, with some serious moral flaws, deserving no more &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; about it than Senator Bob Packwood did about his related tendencies. Meanwhile, black America, having seen that in our times the public can turn on, or trenchantly criticize, a black public figure without igniting a general backlash against black achievement, is less likely to circle the wagons around someone like Cosby than it formerly would have been.</p>
<p>What stings about Cosby is that someone with his warm humor and furious commitment to uplift could at the same time have such a pitilessly abusive take on women and sex. It&rsquo;s like finding this out about your Dad, or certainly for me. Cosby and my own father were both working-class black men of a certain Philadelphia generation, and there was even a commonality of demeanor; my father was funny in the exact same way as Cosby, and danced just like Cosby did in the credits of the Cosby Show.</p>
<p>But Dad didn&rsquo;t rape women. The lesson is that that kind of evil can lurk in the hearts of any kind of man, and we need to watch for it and call it out when it turns up to dissuade its survival in our civilization. And this time we&rsquo;re learning it not from A Black Man, but from someone we, in a way, honor by treating as just a man. Weirdly, this is a kind of progress.</p>

    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-outbrain" data-name="rr-outbrain"><div class="OUTBRAIN" data-src="http://time.com/3598437/charles-manson-supreme-court-gay-marriage/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside><p>When the news broke that Charles Manson had obtained a marriage license while serving out his life sentence in a California prison, we were mad. Really mad. This man was sentenced to death&mdash;a sentence later commuted to life in prison&mdash;after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit mass murder. The Supreme Court has told him that his right to marry is federally protected. That same court has yet to affirm that same right for the LGBT community. The only thing we are guilty of is falling in love with a member of the same sex.</p>
<p>So while Manson and his bride-to-be make their wedding plans, thousands upon thousands of LGBT couples in 15 states, which accounts for nearly 30% of the U.S. population, are left at the altar. Opponents of marriage equality surely can&rsquo;t say that Manson is more worthy of the right to marry than the couples in these states, can they? Would Family Research Council&rsquo;s Tony Perkins rather have a dinner in our loving home or in the jailhouse cafeteria with a man who has no regard for human life? Would Cardinal Timothy Dolan prefer Manson and his &ldquo;Helter Skelter&rdquo; cult to the God and churches that many good and decent LGBT couples pray at and want to be married in? Would National Organization for Marriage&rsquo;s Brian Brown prefer the sanctity of this sham Manson marriage&ndash;to a woman he is not even permitted to have a child with&ndash;over the marriage of loving and committed gay couples who are already raising children?</p>
<p>Our society is affording prison inmates more fairness and dignity than that of our LGBT brothers and sisters. Ted Olson and David Boies, who were our attorneys in the Prop 8 case, underscored this dichotomy to Chief Judge Vaughn Walker in court when fighting for our right to marry. Frankly, we don&rsquo;t care if Manson gets married. It&rsquo;s his right. Good for him. What we can&rsquo;t stand by and tolerate is inaction by the Supreme Court on this issue. The piecemeal approach with which the Court has &ldquo;ruled&rdquo; in favor of marriage equality&ndash;by not ruling on the issue&ndash;is not nearly enough. Now that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed the right for states within its jurisdiction to discriminate against its LGBT citizens by preventing them to marry the person they love, the Supreme Court must agree to hear one or all of the cases and do the right thing. You did it for Manson and now the prison has assigned him a wedding coordinator. We plan great weddings. What about us?</p>

But the results, published online today in the<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/em>, show that <strong>the mobile phone data were better at predicting friendship than the subjects themselves.<\/strong> Thirty-two pairs of subjects switched from calling each other acquaintances to friends in the traditionally gathered survey data. These are most likely new relationships that formed during the course of the study, say the researchers, and they left a clear signal in the mobile phone data. Friends call each other far more often than acquaintances do when they are off-campus and during weekends. <strong>The pattern is so distinct that the researchers spotted budding friendships in the phone data months before the people themselves called themselves friends.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another great <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748704547604576263261679848814.html\" target=\"_blank\">article<\/a> in the WSJ by Robert Lee Hotz about how scientists are using phone data to study our behavior &mdash; and learning more than they ever thought they could:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&hellip;at MIT, scientists who tracked student cellphones during the latest presidential election were able to deduce that two people were talking about politics, even though the researchers didn&rsquo;t know the content of the conversation.

Twelve pieces are on display right now at the Kreeger Museum in Washington, D.C., including my all-time favorite, &#8220;Lament.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So the road started early for me. Telling stories. Communicating a message. Developing my voice in this evolving medium over the course of more than two decades. Sometimes there is no way to take a different path when it is what you love &mdash; even when it doesn&#8217;t love you back.<\/p>\n<p>I trudged through 10 years in local news, worked overnights at CBS News for four years, hosted a cable show for women for two years after that until finally settling into what I thought would be a life-long career as a correspondent for CBS News. My first week on the job was 9\/11. I traveled America finding stories for &#8220;The CBS Evening News,&#8221; &#8220;CBS Sunday Morning,&#8221; even &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; Anchoring the CBS Evening News Sunday edition felt like a feather in my cap.<\/p>\n<p>Just shy of my 40th birthday, the road ended. I was called down to the office of the President of CBS News and was told, &#8220;They were moving in a different direction.&#8221; I was being fired. I. Was. Fired. They liked my work&hellip; but didn&#8217;t like it anymore&hellip; or just had other people coming in&#8230; Whatever it was, my days at CBS News had abruptly come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Being fired is an out-of-body experience. I remember it like it was yesterday. A mixture of anger, feeling victimized, feeling exhilarated and free, and feeling scared shitless all at once. But then the time starts to pass, and if you are like I was, the NEXT job couldn&#8217;t come soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>I sent my work to other networks and the response was&hellip; crickets. I went from everything to everyone to nothing to no one. If I did get an interview, the first question was: Why were you fired? I didn&#8217;t have an answer because I didn&#8217;t really know. Each job interview set me deeper back; deeper into knowing it was over. It&#8217;s hard to fight nothing. No phone ringing. No calls back. Just &#8220;No thank you,&#8221; from everywhere I applied. I would re-apply six months later. Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I did get an audition to anchor the local news at the ABC affiliate in Washington. I was told I was close&#8230; down to three. I went for the audition and was desperate for the job. So desperate it was written all over my face. They gave it to the talented Alison Starling who is still there to this day.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600691\"><\/div>\n<p>At about nine months of nothing, with severance running out, I knew I had to find another road. I began the task of applying for any job anywhere. I was overqualified for many jobs I applied for online, but still got no calls. Slowly&#8230; ever so slowly, I got responses from a few major PR firms. One, just one, called me in for an interview. I had the skills and the experience to do PR well.<\/p>\n<p>It was at this time that a good friend &mdash; a talented producer at CBS News &mdash; was in the process of getter fired too (or &#8220;released from her contract&#8221;). The turnover was continuing there and this time, it was my friend&#8217;s turn. Since I had been through it, I was coaching her through the process &mdash; the hurt, the anger, the loss, the fear. I was reliving it all with her. Knowing the place and the players, it really was like my loss all over again. She was one of the best producers there and had taught me everything I know about voice control, studio tracking and storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>My job interview turned into another one until it was down to a final round. A job as a VP at a major PR firm. Real money. It was the kind of money that would keep the family moving forward. We were at a dead stop with no hope in sight. This job was a potential lifeline&hellip; right there for the taking.<\/p>\n<p>I was waiting for the call to line up the last round. I&#8217;ll never forget the moment. Driving my pickup up the hill near my house, the &#8217;93 Ford 150 with roll-up windows just stopped&hellip; Stalled out and died. I knew that meant another $500 at the shop. $500 that I did not have. Then my cell phone rings. It&#8217;s the PR firm. Wanting to know if I can come in this week&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>I put the truck in park in the middle of the road and listened to myself as I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to come in but I have to be honest; I know someone better for the job. Perfect actually.&#8221; I then began to sing the praises of my soon-to-be fired friend. It came out of my mouth as if I had been practicing it forever&hellip; So easy to say, because it was true. She was perfect for the job, and I was not. I knew this road, as much as I needed one, would not be taken by me.<\/p>\n<p>I remember clunking my head on the steering wheel after I hung up asking myself: &#8220;Why, WHY?? You need a job so badly!&#8221; But I knew it even then. There was still only one road for me&hellip; and that this one wasn&#8217;t it. I knew even then I would have to find my way back to that road I chose at 13 years old. Somehow.<\/p>\n<p>It took many more months, but I called every network known to man and begged for ANY job they had available. I found myself LEAPING at the opportunity to work a day rate, part-time, freelance job at MSNBC reading 30 second news cut-ins &mdash; a job I probably would have scoffed at 15 years prior.<\/p>\n<p>Eight weeks into working the &#8220;cut-in shift&#8221; at MSNBC, Don Imus was knocked off the air for making unfortunate comments.

A Black American woman. I would be so jealous if I were anything else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I learned that &ldquo;Black&rdquo; was intended to mean &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; at the age of five and by the time I was ready for college I had only begun to learn why I should rejoice in my Blackness. I grew up in this spirit. I survived being &ldquo;the smart Black girl&rdquo; at majority white schools in this spirit, and rejected an opportunity for full scholarship at a predominately white institution to attend the best university on the globe (naturally a historically black one) &#8212; because of this spirit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Being a Black person at an HBCU is nothing short of divine. A community of academics who understand you, instructors who are exceptionally hard on you because they know what you&rsquo;re up against in this world, and an ever-present aura that dispels every negative thing that you were taught about your color from the moment you knew what it was.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I chopped off my chemically processed hair, took every class I could led by the master of Africana Studies, Dr. Gregory Carr, and wore an ankh on my body every chance I got.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Needless to say, I only dated Black men.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I find Black men physically attractive, what I really, really find attractive is the unspoken understanding that exists between me and a Black man of my choosing. I love not explaining why I tie my hair up at night, or that my skin would burn in beach sun without sunblock. I love arguing about whether &ldquo;Love Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love and Basketball&rdquo; was the greatest Black love story of the &rsquo;90s. I could never date outside of Black men, I thought. It would never work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But I was W-R-O-N-G! I could and I did.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">We&rsquo;ll call him Mazzi for discretion&rsquo;s sake. He stood about 6 feet and 5 inches. He was handsome, funny, and a bit cynical. We worked in the same space, after I had graduated from college, for about a year. I hardly noticed him at the onset but eventually we began talking and sharing inside jokes and such. And one day he asked me on a date.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">There was naturally some apprehension: 1) because we worked together AND 2) because he was unquestionably a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I expressed my desire to keep it quiet at work and Mazzi agreed, so we went.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I laughed a lot that evening. Like from pick-up to drop-off. As our dates went on for some months, I began to notice the disapproving eyes of people around us when we were out together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Do you see how people look at us?!&rdquo; I asked one day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said nonchalantly. &ldquo;It happens all the time. People don&rsquo;t have shit going on in their own lives so that fact that I&rsquo;m here with this &lsquo;self-aware&rsquo; Black woman is earth shattering to them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He smiled cautiously.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Time passed and we grew closer. I had just gotten into running and he was a thrower for his college&rsquo;s track team so he would offer me advice on what I can do to get faster and stronger (he also gave awesome back rubs). He was a writer who never put his thoughts down and I encouraged him to do so. He had become my sounding board when I would get overwhelmed and met disappointments in my medical school application process, and I was his &ldquo;therapist&rdquo; who eventually got to the root of his cynicism. We were comfortable with one another. At some point in all this, I changed jobs to work in my field and we no longer had the &ldquo;work thing&rdquo; to consider.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600604\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Here I was: Ms. HBCU, Afro-turned locs sporting, ankh wearing, and lover of all things Black &mdash; falling for a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">He brought up the subject of a relationship and I retreated. I&rsquo;d talk about my reluctance to get in relationships (which was true) and he didn&rsquo;t push the issue. But of course eventually I entered a relationship with him because it only made sense.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My two closest friends were shocked but very supportive and liked him a lot. I liked him too. He was the ideal, except he wasn&rsquo;t Black.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My family slowly began to pick up on the fact that this was more than a collection of dates and did not necessarily approve. This didn&rsquo;t impact me so much though. I was good at being rebellious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">His family was really sweet to me and always invited and included me when going to dinners or family parties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I never felt &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; throughout the course of our relationship, race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I remember the first time it was brought to my attention. He was driving and talking to me on the phone with some friends in the car. His friends had been drinking one of them yelled into the phone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Tell Ashley I miss her! Wait! Do Black people miss people?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Now you and I both know how idiotic of a statement that was, but my issue was not with his asshole of a friend, it was with his lack of response to the comment. He later told me he addressed it. I didn&rsquo;t believe him.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">When I would experience &ldquo;exotic otherness&rdquo; at work, I would talk to him about it and he would suggest that I was overreacting when I knew I wasn&rsquo;t. He would never know the feeling I was describing and I really couldn&rsquo;t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/issues\/white-privilege-ferguson\"> expect him to understand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Then once in an argument, he said that my beloved alma mater was &ldquo;institutionally racist.&rdquo; This was a HUGE mistake on his part. I don&rsquo;t remember my exact response but I am certain it was angry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">These were tough issues we had to work through. And it was hard. In considering a future with him, I worried about these issues. And he got to a point where he would refuse to talk if he sensed that race would come up. I understood, it was tense between us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But when it was good, which usually was the case, it was perfect. Then, during a period that I thought was a good one, he went through my phone while I was sleeping. He read messages between my friends and me about how I missed the comfort and familiarity of Black men&#8230; OUCH!<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">To know me is to know that a violation of my privacy is grounds for dismissal. I felt guilty, so I didn&rsquo;t break up with him right way. But from that point forward, I stopped feeling like myself. I was no longer mentally present in the relationship and I strongly resented the phone incident. The race thing was too hard and I had stopped &ldquo;trying&rdquo; because I knew he didn&rsquo;t trust me anyway. I ended it a few months later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">This was in August. And I would be fooling myself if I said I don&rsquo;t sometimes think I made a mistake. In my relationship, I felt special, and I was loved &mdash; even though he wasn&rsquo;t Black.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Someone made a comment to me recently: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came back to this side.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I never changed,&rdquo; because though Mazzi may not have been the guy for me, and though he was undoubtedly a white man, he never wanted anything from me, but me &mdash; locs and all.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/author\/ashley-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">Ashley Thomas<\/a> is an aspiring writer from Baltimore, Maryland.<\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600604\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=I%20Am%20a%20%E2%80%98Conscious%E2%80%99%20Black%20Woman%20Who%20Fell%20for%20a%20White%20Man%20%7C%20TIME&body=I%20Am%20a%20%E2%80%98Conscious%E2%80%99%20Black%20Woman%20Who%20Fell%20for%20a%20White%20Man%0A%0AHere%20I%20was%3A%20Ms.%20HBCU%2C%20Afro-turned-locs-sporting%2C%20ankh-wearing%2C%20and%20lover%20of%20all%20things%20Black%20%E2%80%94%20falling%20for%20a%20white%20man%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600604%2Fblack-woman-fell-for-white-man%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600604%2Fblack-woman-fell-for-white-man%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6Gg&text=I%20am%20a%20%27conscious%27%20black%20woman%20who%20fell%20for%20a%20white%20man&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600604%2Fblack-woman-fell-for-white-man%2F&title=I+Am+a+%E2%80%98Conscious%E2%80%99+Black+Woman+Who+Fell+for+a+White+Man\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600604\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600604\/black-woman-fell-for-white-man\/\" data-title=\"I Am a &amp;#8216;Conscious&amp;#8217; Black Woman Who Fell for a White Man\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.<\/p>\n<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?<\/p>\n<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2014\/11\/19\/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">decided there was not sufficient evidence<\/a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/articles\/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde\/\">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde<\/a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599631\"><\/div>\n<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know<\/em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.<\/p>\n<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.<\/p>\n<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission. That is never an acceptable decision for the chronicler of somebody else&rsquo;s life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/journalism.missouri.edu\/staff\/steve-weinberg\/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Weinberg<\/a>, Professor Emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, has published biographies of Armand Hammer and Ida Tarbell, plus written a book about the craft of biography, T<\/em>elling the Untold Story<em>.

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>osby Show<\/i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?<\/p>\n<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.<\/p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>harm anyone, even indirectly?<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599978\/cosby-show-reruns-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599394\"><\/div>\n<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son<\/em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596545\/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">silence<\/a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599394\"><\/div><\/aside><aside

It can take months, sometimes longer to find a good job, especially if I try to change careers. And I doubt anyone wants to hire a newbie at anywhere near my salary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> But, God, I don&#8217;t want to stay at Western Widget Works, Inc. forever.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> No, but I worry that after all that job hunting, I won&#8217;t even like my new job or career any better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> I need to remember that I don&#8217;t have to take that new job. I just need to take a little time to see if I can find something better. If not, I&#8217;ll stay put. I&#8217;ll just start networking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> But I hate networking and I&#8217;m lousy at it. I just don&#8217;t make a good first impression, no matter how much I practice. I&#8217;m better off spending the time improving my skills: tech stuff, public speaking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> Okay, maybe I should do that, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I shouldn&#8217;t be looking for a job. If I don&#8217;t want to network, I&#8217;ll just answer some on-target ads, one a week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> But if that&#8217;s all I do, a year or two from now, I&#8217;ll probably still be at Western Widget. Ugh.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> So, fine. I&#8217;ll apply to three jobs a week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> But every job opening gets so many applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> I really have to make mine better&mdash;Write a cover letter that, point by point, explains how I meet the job&#8217;s requirements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> But if I&#8217;m changing careers, I won&#8217;t be meeting most of the requirements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> Okay, then I&#8217;ll include a white paper, like a term paper, on a topic related to the new job that would interest that employer. That will show current chops and interest, and a concrete work sample.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> But that will take a ton of time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> No it won&#8217;t. A few-page white paper is like one of those papers I wrote in college. One day I knew nothing about the topic and two days later, I knew a lot and cranked out a good paper.I need to stop complaining. It&#8217;s better than staying at Western Widget. Right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> Maybe. What if the problem isn&#8217;t the job but me? If I&#8217;m honest with myself, as I look back on all my jobs, I&#8217;ve always struggled.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> Do I have to face that I&#8217;m not the sharpest tool in the shed?<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600213\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> That may be part of it. I know that I can&#8217;t seem to make myself consistently care enough about work. I do my job but I can&#8217;t seem to maintain the fire in my belly. I&#8217;m not sure I can change that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> So maybe I need to downscale my job aspirations. Up isn&#8217;t the only way. I fought my way to be a manager, but maybe I&#8217;d be happier and more successful if I did something less demanding.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> Am I the poster boy for the Peter Principle, rising to my level of incompetence?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> Maybe. I&#8217;ve always tried to compete with my high-achieving friends. Isn&#8217;t that silly? Maybe by trying to be what I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m making myself miserable and ensuring I don&#8217;t succeed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> But what should I do?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> Maybe I should go back to being an individual contributor or a support person. I&#8217;m organized and good at details. Maybe I should go back to being a coordinator, a marketing coordinator. Maybe I should talk with my boss or HR about getting that kind of job at Western Widget?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> Actually, I don&#8217;t give a crap about marketing widgets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> I need to remember that as long as the widget is worth marketing, it&#8217;s worth doing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> Stop with the pious preaching.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> How sure am I that I&#8217;ll care more about work if I were doing something else? I say I care about gifted kids being ignored in today&#8217;s elementary schools but would I really, after a honeymoon period, be that much more motivated to work hard on some job related to that, or will my laziness come along with me wherever I go?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> I don&#8217;t want to think I&#8217;m doomed to mediocrity. I can&#8217;t be sure whether I&#8217;ll be any happier on behalf of gifted kids but maybe I should try.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Person:<\/strong> That&#8217;s probably right. I should volunteer a few hours a week at some school with a lot of bright kids or maybe even for a school district&#8217;s director of programs for the gifted. I should do a little networking, make the case that my skills in marketing and being organized and detail oriented would be valuable there. I should apply to jobs anywhere I might be willing to live that excite me. If I get hired, fine. And if not, I&#8217;ll feel better for having tried. And who knows? In spending time around those people quite different from those at Western Widget, I may learn about something or about myself that I wouldn&#8217;t know if I just kept on keeping on with my same-old routine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alter ego:<\/strong> I&#8217;ll think about it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Marty Nemko holds a Ph.D. specializing in education evaluation from U.C.

But as Buress suggested, the cultural stakes are not about Cosby&#8217;s future &mdash; they&#8217;re about his past, his legacy. On the one hand, the public is hearing that a beloved entertainer has been accused of using his power to sexually prey on women for decades. On the other, that entertainer created a long-running TV show that was a landmark not just of entertainment but of American society.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Cosby Show<\/em> is part of our history; it can&#8217;t be erased. (Even if TV Land has pulled its reruns.) It&#8217;s funny, insightful, moving, great. But it is now also &mdash; whatever you think of the allegations and the real-world consequences &mdash; <em>weird<\/em>, in a way that&#8217;s hard to shake.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m not asking here whether it&#8217;s &#8220;OK&#8221; to watch <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>. The moral question of whether to support an artist financially is a different one (and, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2014\/11\/21\/7257417\/bill-cosby-show\" target=\"_blank\">as Todd van der Werff points out at Vox<\/a>, whether or not you watch reruns will make very little difference to Cosby&#8217;s bottom line now). I don&#8217;t want to police that call, and if we ejected every questionable artist from the canon &mdash; abusers, bigots, reprobates &mdash; our bookshelves and movie queues would be a lot lighter.<\/p>\n<p>But it seems hard to hear what we&#8217;ve been hearing and not feel <em>anything<\/em> different when watching Cliff Huxtable making faces and dispensing wisdom. &#8220;Innocent until proven guilty&#8221; is a standard for the courts, for good reason. But it&#8217;s not a standard for life. If what you know or hear about an artist affects the way you see their work, you can no more will yourself to feel otherwise than you can force yourself not to blink.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, bad people can create great works. People are complicated. Art is complicated. And so is the question of whether you can <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/682\/bad-deeds-dont-ruin-great-art\/\" target=\"_blank\">separate the art from the artist<\/a> &mdash; the answer is different for every creator and every audience member. Whatever you think of the disturbing allegations against Woody Allen, for instance, there&#8217;s a good argument that although his movies have often relied on his persona, they don&#8217;t depend on your considering him a morally upstanding person. (Even if some, like <em>Crimes and Misdemeanors<\/em>, turn on issues of morality.)<\/p>\n<p>With <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, though, Bill Cosby the person is throughly and intentionally baked into it&mdash; his identity, his persona, his claimed authority. It&#8217;s not a show made as if it <em>wants<\/em> us to separate the art from the artist, and not just because &#8220;Cosby&#8221; is in the name.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599978\"><\/div>\n<p>Cliff Huxtable isn&#8217;t &mdash; like &#8220;Jerry Seinfeld&#8221; in <em>Seinfeld &mdash; <\/em>a carbon copy of his creator. But Cosby invested himself in Cliff in ways that were deeper and more binding. He drew on his own life, patterning Theo&#8217;s struggles in school, for instance, on his own son Ennis&#8217; diagnosis of dyslexia. Cliff and the show shared Cosby&#8217;s interests in African American high culture, especially jazz.<\/p>\n<p>Cliff liked what Cosby liked, felt what he felt, argued what he argued. He may have had a different job, but more important, he had Cosby&#8217;s sensibility and sense of didactic purpose. As Mark Whitaker pointed out in his biography &mdash; which ignored the rape accusations but delved deep into Cosby&#8217;s creative life &mdash; the comedian mingled his real and fictional lives so thoroughly that during the first season that &#8220;the producers and director started to notice something telling. When they were discussing scripts, he would sometimes slip and refer to his character as Bill instead of Cliff.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That was part of the power of <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>: people&#8217;s affection for Cosby transferred to Cliff, and their respect for Cliff rebounded to Cosby (who at the height of the show&#8217;s popularity wrote the best-selling <em>Fatherhood<\/em>). Everything about this relationship between artist and creation said: <em>Cliff speaks for me<\/em>. And what Cliff had to say was also, deliberately, instructive: about how parents should speak to children, how white Americans should see their African American neighbors, how men should regard women. (See, for instance, the running jokes spoofing the clueless chauvinism of Sondra&#8217;s husband Elvin.)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve rewatched those episodes a lot lately, especially in the last few years as my kids have discovered the reruns on Hulu. They&#8217;re still funny and powerful. They stand up, and they stand on their own. But they&#8217;re also designed to work, in part, by drawing on the moral authority of Cliff and, by extension, Cosby.<\/p>\n<p>We shouldn&#8217;t erase <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>&#8216;s place in TV history &mdash; the way it changed comedy, <a href=\"http:\/\/flavorwire.com\/489681\/the-cosby-show-is-too-important-to-erase-from-tv-history\" target=\"_blank\">represented the unrepresented<\/a> and reframed African Americans in pop culture &mdash; even if it were possible to do so. No one owes it to the rest of the world to stop liking <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>. But it&#8217;s also understandable if, this time, you can&#8217;t easily &#8220;separate the art from the artist,&#8221; when the artist worked so hard and so effectively, for so long, to meld them together.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Cosby Show<\/em> is a great, important, transformational piece of American culture. Nothing Bill Cosby does or has done in real life can ever change that; nor can that ever excuse anything Bill Cosby does or has done in real life.<\/p>\n<p>But will it ever, entirely not be weird? There is no statute of limitations on that.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-shortcode the-brief\">\n<form action=\"https:\/\/ebm.cheetahmail.com\/r\/regf2\" method=\"post\" target=\"time_brief_popup\"

She also recorded a robocall asking that the people of Fayetteville, Arkansas, vote to repeal a law that stops discrimination based on gender identity. Basically she wants people to be able to discriminate against transgender men and women.<\/p>\n<p>Now some people think that we need to silence the Duggars and those like them. I think we should let them keep going. Nothing defeats complacency like knowing exactly where gay people stand with millions of Americans. Now, it&rsquo;s not a shock that the overly religious Duggars don&rsquo;t like gay people. That&rsquo;s sort of like saying that Paula Deen likes butter. But, when gay marriage is passing in state after state, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that not everyone is on the bandwagon. There are still large groups of Americans out there who want to rob us of our rights, and if we don&rsquo;t stay vigilant, we&rsquo;ll never win the war.<\/p>\n<p>Right now we&rsquo;re having a bit of success in dealing with pop culture homophobes. In May, HGTV decided to cancel a show they were planning to air featuring David and Jason Benham when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/05\/08\/showbiz\/tv\/benham-brothers-hgtv\/\">it was discovered<\/a> that they had made some nasty comments about gay people very publicly.<\/p>\n<p>Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty made some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gq.com\/entertainment\/television\/201401\/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson\">very homophobic comments to <em>GQ<\/em><\/a> this January, and <a href=\"http:\/\/popwatch.ew.com\/2014\/05\/23\/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson-antigay-sermon-video\/\">was mouthing off once again<\/a> this May about how gay sex is unnatural. He was suspended from A&amp;E briefly for his behavior and the ratings for the show <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/tv\/duck-dynasty-ratings-fall-even-further-in-second-episode-after-robertson-controversy\/\">tanked after his disclosure<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599721\"><\/div>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we need these people to keep talking. There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that there is hatred in the hearts of many people for LGBTQ men and women in this country, but if that hatred just stays in their hearts they&rsquo;ll be working against us without our knowledge. The louder they become, the easier it is to target them. And when we can target them, well, we&rsquo;ve seen that we can do things to shut them up. If only we could give them all a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dS91gT3XT_A\">pie in the face<\/a> like Anita Bryant got.<\/p>\n<p>Having loudmouth opponents also serves as an effective recruiting tool for allies to gay civil rights causes. Like it or not, reality stars like the Duggars and especially the Robertsons&ndash;whose most recent season finale still clocked almost <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewrap.com\/duck-dynasty-finale-ratings-drop-from-season-5-ender\/\" target=\"_blank\">4 million viewers<\/a>&ndash;have a huge stage. When they make these sorts of remarks there is always a media firestorm and each time that happens, I would like to think that there is at least one fan out there who thinks, &ldquo;God, what an idiot.&rdquo; Hopefully that opens up some minds and shows those out there who may not be very hospitable to the &ldquo;gay lifestyle&rdquo; that bigotry is distasteful no matter how it manifests itself.<\/p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t get to teach these lessons, show our strength or fight these battles if these people are silent. We need people like Michelle Duggar to be loud in order to get the hard work of activism done. So no matter how much it sucks, we have to just take it on the chin every time one of these yahoos has the bright idea to spout off. Trust me, it&rsquo;s for the greater good. Every time a reality star says something ignorant about the LGBT community, a gay angel gets her wings.<\/p>\n<p>Oscar Wilde, one of the world&rsquo;s most public and tragic gay men, said &ldquo;True friends stab you in the front.&rdquo; There is no doubt in my mind that there are plenty of misinformed people in America carrying daggers against gay people, including those who have a public forum to discuss those views. Why would we want them hiding that hatred in the shadows when, out in the open, it can be diffused, acted on and used as a teaching tool to get more people on our side. We should all thank Michelle Duggar. She thinks that she&rsquo;s stabbing gay Americans in the front, but what she&rsquo;s really doing is bloodying herself.<\/p>\n<p><em>Brian Moylan is a writer and pop culture junkie who lives in New York.

When black comedian Hannibal Buress <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2014\/10\/hannibal-buress-called-bill-cosby-a-rapist.html\" target=\"_blank\">charged<\/a> that Cosby is a racist, sparking the latest events when the clip went viral, Buress was explicit that it rankles him that Cosby has called for black people to &ldquo;Pull your pants up,&rdquo; etc. when Cosby himself had, shall we say, not done so.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, the dirt on Cosby had been aired far and wide soon after the Pound Cake speech, with black author and pundit Michael Eric Dyson even covering the territory in his 2005 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bill-Cosby-Right-Black-Middle\/dp\/0465017207\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416532330&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=is+bill+cosby+right\">book<\/a>, a broadside against Cosby&rsquo;s cultural opinions. Newsweek, The Today Show, People, and other sources chimed in around the same time. No one remotely interested in Cosby could have missed the charges, and while today Twitter and Facebook get things around especially quickly, by 2005 and 2006 broadband and blogs were already influencing opinion at a dizzying rate. Irritation over Cosby&rsquo;s views alone, then, did not threaten his iconic status &mdash; especially given that more black people than often acknowledged actually concur with Cosby&rsquo;s cultural opinions.<\/p>\n<p>The second factor in why Cosby has been outed now &mdash; one that is key, but not decisive &mdash; is that sexual violation of women has been so widely discussed in America over the past few years. The &ldquo;legitimate rape&rdquo; conceptions of congressman Todd Akin and today&rsquo;s calls for universities to address the frequency of rape on their campuses have made it much less likely that Cosby&rsquo;s behavior could be given a pass.<\/p>\n<p>But even this doesn&rsquo;t fully answer the &ldquo;Why now?&rdquo; question. Enlightened American sensibilities about rape have not taken a quantum leap since, say, 2005. The major dividing line for that would be in the early &#8217;90s, when sexual harassment and date rape entered mainstream discussion and forever banished the old-time Mad Men idea that such things were a mere matter of some men being &ldquo;all hands.&rdquo; Who by 2005, upon hearing about what Cosby did, was thinking &ldquo;Oh well, boys will be boys!&rdquo;?<\/p>\n<p>We get closer to truth in Rebecca Traister&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newrepublic.com\/article\/120338\/bill-cosby-rape-allegations-why-america-took-so-long-wake\">point<\/a> that America has been afraid to condemn Cosby out of a sense that it would be almost sacrilegious to pull down such an iconic representation of blackness. More specifically, whites have given him a pass out of a sense that it would be racist not to, while blacks have been reluctant to assist in the defrocking of such a beloved figure, chary of aiding and abetting whites in racist dismissal of black achievement and authority.<\/p>\n<p>What has made the difference is that certain happenings of late have let America make a particular kind of post-Civil Rights adjustment: getting past the polite fiction that all criticisms of a black person are racist, and if not overtly then &ldquo;on a certain level.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599400\"><\/div>\n<p>Namely here is where Cain and Obama come in. The implosion of Herman Cain&rsquo;s quest for the Republican nomination in 2011 in the wake of charges (from white women) of sexual harassment and infidelity was a handy transition. Cain&rsquo;s Republican politics and jolly dismissal of traditional Civil Rights positions meant that few blacks were primed to dismiss the accusations against him as racist, as a &ldquo;lynching,&rdquo; and so on. Instead, we simply saw Cain as a man brought down for proper reasons, his color beside the point.<\/p>\n<p>It probably had to be a black Republican that this happened to. But since then, a consensus has settled in on the question as to how much of a part racism plays in the animus of those who dislike President Obama. And the verdict is: racism does play some part. But still, only ideologues think racism is the only reason, or even close to the only reason, someone might not be crazy about Obama&rsquo;s performance in the Oval Office.<\/p>\n<p>At best, Obama is likely to go down as having been an OK President, and in grappling with that, Blue America has gotten a quiet lesson in evaluating black people according to the content of their character &mdash; despite having thought they already did that by voting for him in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Hence a moment when it is newly easy to see Cosby not as a Black Gentleman With Some Issues but as a man, period, with some serious moral flaws, deserving no more &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; about it than Senator Bob Packwood did about his related tendencies. Meanwhile, black America, having seen that in our times the public can turn on, or trenchantly criticize, a black public figure without igniting a general backlash against black achievement, is less likely to circle the wagons around someone like Cosby than it formerly would have been.<\/p>\n<p>What stings about Cosby is that someone with his warm humor and furious commitment to uplift could at the same time have such a pitilessly abusive take on women and sex. It&rsquo;s like finding this out about your Dad, or certainly for me. Cosby and my own father were both working-class black men of a certain Philadelphia generation, and there was even a commonality of demeanor; my father was funny in the exact same way as Cosby, and danced just like Cosby did in the credits of the Cosby Show.<\/p>\n<p>But Dad didn&rsquo;t rape women. The lesson is that that kind of evil can lurk in the hearts of any kind of man, and we need to watch for it and call it out when it turns up to dissuade its survival in our civilization. And this time we&rsquo;re learning it not from A Black Man, but from someone we, in a way, honor by treating as just a man. Weirdly, this is a kind of progress.<\/p>\n<div class=\"newsletter-shortcode the-brief\">\n<form action=\"https:\/\/ebm.cheetahmail.com\/r\/regf2\" method=\"post\" target=\"time_brief_popup\" onsubmit=\"window.open(this.action, 'time_brief_popup', 'width=486,height=250');\">\n    <label class=\"intro\"><small>Sign Up for<\/small> <span class=\"no-wrap\">THE <strong class=\"time-red\">BRIEF<\/strong><\/span> <small class=\"and-more\">and more<\/small> <small class=\"example\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/the-brief\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small><\/label>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"n\" value=\"4\">\n    <input name=\"aid\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1078532063\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fsub\" value=\"2095224265\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"TIME_SOURCE\" value=\"shortcode_thebrief\">\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"re\" value=\"http:\/\/f.time.chtah.net\/i\/30\/1078532063\/thanks.html\">\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"text input-field email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" class=\"submit button\" value=\"Submit\">\n<small class=\"example after\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/newsletter\/the-brief\/\" target=\"_blank\">view example<\/a><\/small>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Read next: <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3598207\/bill-cosby-rape-accusations-silence\/?xid=time_readnext\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Cosby, Camille Cosby and the Oppressive Power of Silence<\/a><\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599400\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=How%20Herman%20Cain%20and%20President%20Obama%20Brought%20Down%20Bill%20Cosby%20%7C%20TIME&body=How%20Herman%20Cain%20and%20President%20Obama%20Brought%20Down%20Bill%20Cosby%0A%0AThe%20allegations%20have%20been%20around%20for%20years.%20But%20we%27re%20only%20now%20willing%20to%20judge%20black%20icons%20like%20everybody%20else.%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599400%2Fcosby-rape-black-icons%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599400%2Fcosby-rape-black-icons%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6mQ&text=John%20McWhorter%3A%20Why%20we%27re%20just%20now%20willing%20to%20judge%20Bill%20Cosby%E2%80%94a%20black%20icon%E2%80%94like%20anyone%20else%3A&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599400%2Fcosby-rape-black-icons%2F&title=How+Herman+Cain+and+President+Obama+Brought+Down+Bill+Cosby\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3599400\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599400\/cosby-rape-black-icons\/\" data-title=\"How Herman Cain and President Obama Brought Down Bill Cosby\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

Really mad. This man was sentenced to death&mdash;a sentence later commuted to life in prison&mdash;after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit mass murder. The Supreme Court has told him that his right to marry is federally protected. That same court has yet to affirm that same right for the LGBT community. The only thing we are guilty of is falling in love with a member of the same sex.<\/p>\n<p>So while Manson and his bride-to-be make their wedding plans, thousands upon thousands of LGBT couples in 15 states, which accounts for nearly 30% of the U.S. population, are left at the altar. Opponents of marriage equality surely can&rsquo;t say that Manson is more worthy of the right to marry than the couples in these states, can they? Would Family Research Council&rsquo;s Tony Perkins rather have a dinner in our loving home or in the jailhouse cafeteria with a man who has no regard for human life? Would Cardinal Timothy Dolan prefer Manson and his &ldquo;Helter Skelter&rdquo; cult to the God and churches that many good and decent LGBT couples pray at and want to be married in? Would National Organization for Marriage&rsquo;s Brian Brown prefer the sanctity of this sham Manson marriage&ndash;to a woman he is not even permitted to have a child with&ndash;over the marriage of loving and committed gay couples who are already raising children?<\/p>\n<p>Our society is affording prison inmates more fairness and dignity than that of our LGBT brothers and sisters. Ted Olson and David Boies, who were our attorneys in the Prop 8 case, underscored this dichotomy to Chief Judge Vaughn Walker in court when fighting for our right to marry. Frankly, we don&rsquo;t care if Manson gets married. It&rsquo;s his right. Good for him. What we can&rsquo;t stand by and tolerate is inaction by the Supreme Court on this issue. The piecemeal approach with which the Court has &ldquo;ruled&rdquo; in favor of marriage equality&ndash;by not ruling on the issue&ndash;is not nearly enough. Now that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed the right for states within its jurisdiction to discriminate against its LGBT citizens by preventing them to marry the person they love, the Supreme Court must agree to hear one or all of the cases and do the right thing. You did it for Manson and now the prison has assigned him a wedding coordinator. We plan great weddings. What about us?<\/p>\n<p><em>Jeff Zarrillo and Paul Katami were plaintiffs in the landmark Supreme Court decision in the federal lawsuit against Proposition 8 in California.<\/em><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3598437\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Prop.%208%20Plaintiffs%3A%20Charles%20Manson%20Can%20Get%20Married%2C%20But%20We%20Still%20Can%E2%80%99t%20%7C%20TIME&body=Prop.%208%20Plaintiffs%3A%20Charles%20Manson%20Can%20Get%20Married%2C%20But%20We%20Still%20Can%E2%80%99t%0A%0ABy%20not%20ruling%20on%20marriage%20equality%2C%20murderers%20are%20afforded%20more%20fairness%20and%20dignity%20than%20our%20LGBT%20brothers%20and%20sisters%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598437%2Fcharles-manson-supreme-court-gay-marriage%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598437%2Fcharles-manson-supreme-court-gay-marriage%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f67j&text=Supreme%20Court%20inaction%20on%20gay%20marriage%20means%20Charles%20Manson%20can%20get%20married%2C%20but%20we%20still%20can%27t&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598437%2Fcharles-manson-supreme-court-gay-marriage%2F&title=Prop.+8+Plaintiffs%3A+Charles+Manson+Can+Get+Married%2C+But+We+Still+Can%E2%80%99t\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3598437\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3598437\/charles-manson-supreme-court-gay-marriage\/\" data-title=\"Prop. 8 Plaintiffs: Charles Manson Can Get Married, But We Still Can&amp;#8217;t\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.
