In the future, doctors hope similar tech could be used on viruses like hepatitis.<\/p>\n","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions38.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions38.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions38.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions38.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions38.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Tara Johnson for TIME","caption":"","alt":"IMG_0538_sand stick.JPG","providers":[]},"edit_link":null,"email_title":"The%20Filter%20that%20Fights%20Ebola%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"The%20Filter%20that%20Fights%20Ebola%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3594971%2Fthe-25-best-inventions-of-2014%2Fitem%2Fthe-filter-that-fights-ebola%2F","contributor":false,"first":false,"length":25},{"id":3596026,"title":"The Selfie Stick (and Hairbrush)","slug":"the-selfie-streamliners","encoded_title":"The%20Selfie%20Stick%20%28and%20Hairbrush%29%20%7C%20The%2025%20Best%20Inventions%20of%202014","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3594971%2Fthe-25-best-inventions-of-2014%2Fitem%2Fthe-selfie-streamliners%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f5uq","twitter_via":"TIME","twitter_text":"The%2025%20Best%20Inventions%20of%202014%3A%20The%20Selfie%20Stick%20%28and%20Hairbrush%29","ranking":null,"content":"<p>If 2013 was the year in which <em>selfie<\/em> became a buzzword, then 2014 was the year selfies became a cultural phenomenon.

Experts say a sizable portion of that is waste. IT consultant Garthen Leslie realized as much while driving to work last summer in Washington, past rows of empty-looking houses with humming window units that could not be turned on or off remotely. There had to be a better way. &#8220;So I sent an idea to Quirky,&#8221; he says, referring to the GE-backed site that turns people&#8217;s concepts into creations. Four months later, they had a prototype.<\/p>\n<p>The Aros air conditioner, which has sold nearly 50,000 units since its May 2014 release, is a provocative departure from the familiar window unit. For one thing, it&#8217;s elegant, with a sleek white exterior that&#8217;s almost Apple-esque. It&#8217;s smart too. Thanks to a companion mobile app, Aros can track owners&#8217; movements via GPS and turn itself on and off depending on their proximity to home. It also tells people exactly how much money they&#8217;re spending to cool their residences. That&#8217;s how Quirky knows it&#8217;s working: so far, the company says, Aros owners who use the &#8220;smart away&#8221; feature that turns the unit on and off automatically have trimmed their energy use by nearly 10%.<\/p>\n","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions4.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions4.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions4.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions4.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/best-inventions4.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Amy Lombard for TIME","caption":"","alt":"_MG_6107.JPG","providers":[]},"edit_link":null,"email_title":"The%20AC%20that%20Lowers%20Your%20Energy%20Bills%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"The%20AC%20that%20Lowers%20Your%20Energy%20Bills%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3594971%2Fthe-25-best-inventions-of-2014%2Fitem%2Fthe-ac-that-lowers-your-energy-bills%2F","contributor":false,"first":false,"length":25},{"id":3596053,"title":"The Prison Room that Helps Inmates Relax","slug":"the-prison-room-that-helps-inmates-relax","encoded_title":"The%20Prison%20Room%20that%20Helps%20Inmates%20Relax%20%7C%20The%2025%20Best%20Inventions%20of%202014","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3594971%2Fthe-25-best-inventions-of-2014%2Fitem%2Fthe-prison-room-that-helps-inmates-relax%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f5uR","twitter_via":"TIME","twitter_text":"The%2025%20Best%20Inventions%20of%202014%3A%20The%20Prison%20Room%20that%20Helps%20Inmates%20Relax","ranking":null,"content":"<p><strong>&#8220;Blue Room&#8221;<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Developed by Snake River Correctional Institution in Oregon<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For 23 hours a day, the 200 inmates in solitary confinement at Oregon&#8217;s largest prison see nothing but a tiny, white-walled cell&mdash;an experience some research suggests can heighten mental illness and make prisoners prone to suicide attempts and violence.

Each state set its own policy on naturalization, with the potential for chaos. Hence the founders, who gathered in 1787 in Philadelphia to write the Constitution, granted to Congress the power to &#8220;establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.&#8221; They could have granted this to the President or left it to the states, but they assigned it instead to Congress.<\/p>\n<p>So Obama, in threatening to act on his own, is playing with constitutional fire. It&#8217;s not that I object to his liberality on immigration. On the contrary, for years I was part of the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s editorial page. It reckons that it would be illogical to stand for the free movement of trade and capital absent the free movement of labor. It once called for a constitutional amendment saying &#8220;there shall be open borders.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That is based on the idea of human capital, the notion that in a system of democratic capitalism people have an incentive to produce more than they themselves consume. This system discovers that more people lead to a richer society for all. In my generation, this point animated the campaign for America to take in the boat people escaping Vietnam after the communist conquest. What a windfall they turned out to be.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3596970\"><\/div>\n<p>I have also long plumped for a merger of pro-immigration activists and pro-life conservatives. A movement that cherishes pro-life principles contradicts itself when it emerges against immigration. Better to press consistently for the idea that more people are better, particularly in a country as underpopulated as the U.S., which ranks near the bottom of the world&#8217;s nations in population density.<\/p>\n<p>All that, though, is trumped by the constitution. It not only seats naturalization power in Congress but also gives it almost total sway. The founders discussed adding language relating to how long someone must reside in America before becoming a citizen. In the end they required of Congress only that its rule be &#8220;uniform.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t want the states feuding over this and setting competing policies. They wanted a united front to the world.<\/p>\n<p>Nor, the record suggests, did they want the President setting policies on immigration and naturalization. There may be talk about Obama having presidential &#8220;discretion&#8221; in enforcing immigration laws, but the record of the Constitutional Convention makes clear where the founders wanted discretion to lie. &#8220;The right of determining the rule of naturalization will then leave a discretion to the legislature,&#8221; James Madison quotes Alexander Hamilton as saying.<\/p>\n<p>Madison followed by remarking that he &#8220;wished to maintain the character of liberality&#8221; that had been &#8220;professed&#8221; throughout the states. He was not for open immigration. He &#8220;wished to invite foreigners of merit and republican principles among us.&#8221; He noted that &#8220;America was indebted to emigration for her settlement and prosperity&#8221; and added, &#8220;That part of America which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population, agriculture, and the arts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Founding Fathers were not naive. They worried plenty about intrigue by what Madison, at one point, called &#8220;men with foreign predilections&#8221; who might &#8220;obtain appointments&#8221; or even seek public office. One can imagine that they would be horrified by the loss of control of the southern border, the lawlessness, the abuse of welfare and the scent of rebellion north of the Rio Grande. But the founders also feared a King&#8211;or a President who acted like one. They wanted the question of immigration settled by Congress and wrote an impeachment clause that glints in the fray.<\/p>\n<p>Lipsky is the editor of the New York Sun<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE: The Writings of James Madison, Volume IV<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3596970\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=A%20Constitutional%20Moment%20%7C%20TIME&body=A%20Constitutional%20Moment%0A%0AThe%20Founding%20Fathers%20were%20clear%20about%20who%20sets%20immigration%20policy%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596970%2Fa-constitutional-moment%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596970%2Fa-constitutional-moment%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f5JE&text=A%20Constitutional%20Moment&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596970%2Fa-constitutional-moment%2F&title=A+Constitutional+Moment\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3596970\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596970\/a-constitutional-moment\/\" data-title=\"A Constitutional Moment\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=A%20Constitutional%20Moment&amp;publicationDate=11\/20\/2014&amp;author=Seth%20Lipsky&amp;contentID=3596970&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

You bet he can. He has the power to set law-enforcement priorities. In 2012, Barack Obama ordered that children brought across the border by their parents and raised in the U.S.&#8211;the so-called Dream Generation&#8211;should not be targeted for deportation. He can expand that ruling to their parents and others. Both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush took similar actions on a smaller scale. The question is, why on earth would the President want to do it now, after the disastrous election of 2014? Newly minted Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said it would be like &#8220;waving a red flag in front of a bull,&#8221; which may have been more artful than literal. McConnell also said that he wouldn&#8217;t shut down the government (nor will the Republican leadership move toward impeachment). The President may have simply calculated that signing his executive actions would be more like waving a tissue in front of a goat.<\/p>\n<p>It is not impossible that Obama is playing some hard-nosed politics here, even if his primary motivation is soft-nosed and idealistic. It is simple humanitarian justice not to separate families by deporting the parents of the Dream Generation. If John Boehner had brought last year&#8217;s bipartisan Senate immigration bill to a vote in the House, the situation might have been happily resolved. &#8220;But it&#8217;s like waiting for a bus that never comes,&#8221; says David Axelrod, a former Obama aide. The Republican definition of immigration reform is unacceptable to most Democrats. It consists of more money for border security and a fast track for skilled foreigners who want to immigrate; it does not include a path to legality for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here. Obama no doubt calculated that negotiations with the GOP on this issue were futile. On top of that, the President may not be too pleased with the members of his inner circle who told him to delay his executive actions last summer for &#8220;political&#8221; reasons, as he so awkwardly put it&#8211;that is, to save some Democratic Senate candidates who ultimately could not be saved. This President does not like to come off as tawdry or political. A quick executive move now is a way to rectify the games he&#8217;s played with Latinos.<\/p>\n<p>But it also may be effective politics. In the long term, every time the Republicans start screaming and stomping about illegal Mexicans, it cements the Latino relationship with the Democratic Party, a demographic boon. There will certainly be a lot of screaming when Obama goes ahead with his plan&#8211;and then we will celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas, a traditionally fallow political period, and the immigration issue will be ancient history by the time McConnell convenes his Republican-majority Senate in January. Hence, another calculation: Despite the immigration order, the Republicans will still want to do business with the President. They will want to demonstrate that gridlock was all Harry Reid&#8217;s fault. The Republican Senators up for re-election in 2016 will need some bacon to bring home. There are trade bills that Republicans will certainly want to pass, and infrastructure bills, and perhaps even some tax reform. Obama will share the credit for those middling triumphs, and he&#8217;ll seem tough besides, having blasted through the &#8220;red flag&#8221; and gotten stuff done.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3596973\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"1\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3899864728001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f5JH\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3899864728001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>But there will be consequences. By moving ahead with the immigration plan, Obama sacrifices any leeway he might have had with Republicans on a range of more difficult issues. He was going to have a tough time selling an Iran nuclear deal&#8211;if there is such a deal&#8211;to Congress, but it could become impossible now. There will be all sorts of Obamacare challenges, some of which might have been avoided if the President had not pierced the illusion of comity. Democrats will argue that Obama was played for a sucker every time he anticipated the possibility of Republican compromise, and there is a lot to that. But that may well have been the last war. The coming legislative battles could be more subtle and pliable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He may be trying to goad us into doing something stupid&#8221; like shutting down the government or moving toward impeachment, says Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221; Indeed, Republicans have been talking in more surgical fiscal terms&#8211;defunding specific programs, like those that would implement the executive actions, rather than a wholesale shutdown. Worse, Obama&#8217;s immigration actions, noble as they might be, fly in the face of the national mood. At a moment when the public desperately wants some sort of reconciliation, he is sticking a finger in McConnell&#8217;s eye. After playing the reasonable grownup for the first six years of his presidency, he is giving up the high ground.<\/p>\n<p>TO READ JOE&#8217;S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com\/swampland<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3891588699001-2\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f5JH\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3891588699001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3596973\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone%20%7C%20TIME&body=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone%0A%0AThe%20President%20has%20good%20reason%20to%20bypass%20Congress.%20But%20he%E2%80%99ll%20pay%20a%20price%0D%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596973%2Ftackling-immigration-alone%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596973%2Ftackling-immigration-alone%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f5JH&text=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596973%2Ftackling-immigration-alone%2F&title=Tackling+Immigration+Alone\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3596973\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596973\/tackling-immigration-alone\/\" data-title=\"Tackling Immigration Alone\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone&amp;publicationDate=11\/20\/2014&amp;author=Joe%20Klein&amp;contentID=3596973&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

While growth and jobs are up, only about 1 in 4 Americans believes the economy is getting stronger, according to a recent survey by the investment firm BlackRock. The reason is clear: personal incomes aren&#8217;t rising, except at the very top. Historically, the key to achieving broad income growth has been creating more middle-income jobs.

GE, in other words, is trying to do what the U.S. as a whole needed to do: rebalance its economy and get back to basics.<\/p>\n<p>So, six years on from disaster, how is it going?<\/p>\n<p>Immelt has made progress. With the recent spin-off of GE&#8217;s consumer-finance division, which peddles financial products ranging from private-label credit cards to auto loans, the share of profits that comes from finance has gone from more than half to about 40%. The target is to get it back down to around 25%. As CFO Jeff Bornstein recently put it to me, &#8220;We had to decide whether we wanted to be a tech company that solves the world&#8217;s big problems or a finance company that makes a few things.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>GE&#8217;s executives are betting on a few megatrends, including the belief that emerging-market economies are entering a period very much like the post&#8211;World War II period in the U.S. Those countries will need new houses, bridges, roads, airports and all types of consumer goods in unprecedented quantities. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2025, emerging-economy nations will spend more than $20 trillion a year in this way. That means that future economic growth may well be centered on making things, rather than trading on their value.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3596974\"><\/div>\n<p>To help capture its share of that action, GE is trying to copy some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s methods. The company has set up a &#8220;growth board&#8221; that operates like an internal venture-capital firm, vetting new ideas presented by employees and then dishing out a bit of time and capital to explore them. The result is that production cycles for projects like new oil-drilling equipment or LED lighting systems are shortening dramatically. An idea that once took two years to test might go from paper to production in 45 days.<\/p>\n<p>The firm is also sourcing new ideas from the crowd. One recent design for a bracket on a jet engine came from a 22-year-old in Indonesia who had tapped into a website where the company posts problems and offers payouts to whoever can solve them.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the big question is just how many good new jobs America&#8217;s industrial firms, small and large, will actually create in the coming years. So far, the trends are positive. In October, the Boston Consulting Group&#8217;s annual survey of senior manufacturing executives found that the number of respondents bringing production back from China to the U.S. had risen 20% in the past year. GE&#8217;s new hub in San Ramon, Calif., which was launched more than two years ago to explore the burgeoning &#8220;Internet of things&#8221; (i.e., machine-to-machine communication via the Internet), has gone from zero employees to more than 1,000. The company is also using more local small and midsize suppliers, thanks to new technologies like 3-D printing that let startups achieve more speed and scale.<\/p>\n<p>Such trends at GE and elsewhere have yet to replace the 1.6 million manufacturing jobs lost in the recession. The good news about our postcrisis economy is that it is smarter and nimbler and growing in the right sectors. The bad news is that it still doesn&#8217;t have enough good jobs for those who need them. The way forward may be clear, but getting there is another story.<\/p>\n<p>TO READ JOE&#8217;S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com\/swampland<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3596974\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=GE%20Makes%20a%20Big%20Bet%20on%20Manufacturing%20%7C%20TIME&body=GE%20Makes%20a%20Big%20Bet%20on%20Manufacturing%0A%0AThe%20company%E2%80%99s%20plan%20to%20make%20things%20again%20is%20a%20test%20for%20the%20entire%20American%20economy%0D%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596974%2Fge-makes-a-big-bet-on-manufacturing%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596974%2Fge-makes-a-big-bet-on-manufacturing%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f5JI&text=GE%20Makes%20a%20Big%20Bet%20on%20Manufacturing&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596974%2Fge-makes-a-big-bet-on-manufacturing%2F&title=GE+Makes+a+Big+Bet+on+Manufacturing\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3596974\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596974\/ge-makes-a-big-bet-on-manufacturing\/\" data-title=\"GE Makes a Big Bet on Manufacturing\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=GE%20Makes%20a%20Big%20Bet%20on%20Manufacturing&amp;publicationDate=11\/20\/2014&amp;author=Rana%20Foroohar&amp;contentID=3596974&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

There is no reason, in the next few years, that we cannot virtually end mother-to-child transmission of HIV in even the most challenging environments. Unheralded, we just passed a tipping point: in 2013, more people were added to the rolls of those on lifesaving treatment for HIV\/AIDS than the number who were newly infected. That crossover of trend lines should mark the beginning of the end of AIDS.<\/p>\n<p>Say those last seven words out loud and wonder at them. How did we get to a position that, had it been suggested not long ago, would have been thought impossible? Because of brave, stubborn activists; brilliant scientists and their generous funders; dedicated doctors and nurses; patients who fought for a chance to live; and officials and politicians of all political stripes and none who devised programs that gave those patients hope. And just to be clear, those countless heroes and heroines came from all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>But when, at the National Institutes of Health in 2011, Hillary Clinton, then U.S. Secretary of State, said, &#8220;In the story of this fight, America&#8217;s name comes up time and time again &#8230; No institution in the world has done more than the United States government,&#8221; she was speaking not hyperbole but truth.<\/p>\n<p>For here is what seems like a secret but shouldn&#8217;t be: in the past decade, Americans and their Presidents have done a great thing. From 2004 to 2013, the U.S. committed more than $50 billion to the global fight against AIDS, and last year accounted for some two-thirds of all international assistance to that effort. (About half the money to combat AIDS in the developing world now comes from the budgets of countries there.) Programs funded by American taxpayers have saved more than 7 million lives overseas.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another thing that would surprise Americans if they knew about it: in a Washington that has become a byword for dysfunction, the war on AIDS has been a model of comity. There have been political disagreements to be sure, but thanks to the work of two Administrations of different hues and countless congressional heroes from both sides of the aisle, support for the international fight against AIDS has remained solidly bipartisan.<\/p>\n<p>How come? At the heart of this story are two simple and rather old-fashioned ideas. Think big, and stay with what works. For the first insight, credit the Administration of George W. Bush. The 43rd President had come into office interested in Africa&#8217;s untapped potential, and in the summer of 2001 he pledged $200 million to the new Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A year later, he committed $500 million to fight mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The next day, he called Josh Bolten, then his deputy chief of staff, into the Oval Office and told him, &#8220;Think even bigger.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3596985\"><\/div>\n<p>Twelve years on, Bolten still muses on the various elements&#8211;strategic, managerial, religious&#8211;that made Bush so relentless in his determination to do something about AIDS. Bush plainly felt that the U.S., with all its blessings, had a duty to others less fortunate. Bolten remembers&#8211;as does Michael Gerson, then Bush&#8217;s chief speechwriter&#8211;the President&#8217;s frequent quotation from Luke&#8217;s Gospel that &#8220;to whom much is given, much is required.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But for whatever reason, Bush thought big, and his team&#8211;Bolten; Gerson; Tony Fauci, the veteran AIDS researcher at the National Institutes of Health; and others&#8211;delivered. In his State of the Union message in January 2003, Bush announced a truly astonishing $15 billion commitment to tackle AIDS in Africa, in what became PEPFAR, the President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which remains the largest program devoted to combatting a single disease that any nation has ever launched.<\/p>\n<p>The speech and the pledge were the drama. but it is perhaps what has happened since&#8211;the quotidian business of sticking with what works&#8211;that has been most inspiring about the U.S. effort on AIDS. On World AIDS Day in 2011, President Barack Obama paid tribute to Bush and PEPFAR and said he was &#8220;proud that we have the opportunity to carry that work forward.&#8221; That the President did&#8211;working again with a bipartisan coalition on the Hill&#8211;and then some. At a time of fiscal austerity that extended to every element of the federal budget, the amount the U.S. committed to PEPFAR and the Global Fund grew from $5.8 billion in fiscal year 2008 to $6.3 billion in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>PEPFAR has evolved to follow where the science leads us. We now know, for example, that antiretroviral treatment and voluntary male circumcision can serve as prevention tools, reducing the risk of passing HIV on to others. So the program has scaled up its efforts in those areas while also targeting its resources to the regions of greatest need. But what Obama said in 2011 remains true: &#8220;The fight against this disease has united us across parties and across Presidents.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Long may it do so. Sustained American leadership remains vital. But wherever the funding comes from, there will still be challenges. Already, the disease is concentrated among vulnerable populations, some of them hard to reach and treat for reasons of social stigma or isolation, including men who have sex with men, injection-drug users, female sex workers, adolescent girls and the disabled. Other developed nations need to step up and join the U.S. in its commitment, and national governments in the developing world need to keep their promises to spend more on health.<\/p>\n<p>But given what has been done in the past few years, it would be churlish to assume the worst. In the past decade, in HIV\/AIDS policy, science and treatment, the world has seen miracles: big ones, involving millions of people on lifesaving drugs, and small ones, like a mother with the disease giving birth to a healthy child.<\/p>\n<p>Most miracles are a mystery.

Benedict&#8217;s mother Wanda Ventham advised him to choose a moniker less &#8230; cumbersome &#8230; for his acting career; his father went by the stage name Timothy Carlton. But the young man must have appreciated the curious loftiness of this word, which comes from Old English and loosely means &#8220;stream in a valley.&#8221; And after all, the name was his. So he found roles suitable for a Benedict Cumberbatch: men above and apart, like Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series, Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate, Stephen Hawking in a TV movie. Fantasy filmmakers recognized his intimidating radiance and cast him as Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness and the Necromancer and Smaug in the Hobbit movies. Soon he will be Marvel&#8217;s Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600706\/jennifer-lawrence-sing-mockingjay\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Hear Jennifer Lawrence Sing in Mockingjay<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599607\/imitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">The History Behind Benedict Cumberbatch&#8217;s <i>The Imitation Game<\/i><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/michael-brown-shooting\/pair-suspected-trying-acquire-bombs-ferguson-protests-n254021?cid=par-time_20141122\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Feds Suspect Pair Sought Bombs for Ferguson Protests <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/crime-courts\/ohio-men-wrongly-convicted-murder-after-39-years-released-n253356?cid=par-time_20141122\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Two Ohio Men Wrongly Convicted of Murder Walk Free <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/fsu-shooter-myron-may-left-message-i-do-not-want-n253436?cid=par-time_20141122\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">FSU Shooter Left Message: 'I Do Not Want to Die in Vain' <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Alan Turing in The Imitation Game may be the actor&#8217;s oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet. The Cambridge genius who fathered the modern computer, known as the Turing machine&#8211;and who presciently asked, &#8220;What if only a machine could defeat another machine?&#8221;&#8211;seems part machine himself. Carrying himself with the hauteur of some creature from an advanced species on its first trip to Earth, he joins the Bletchley Park team charged with breaking the Nazis&#8217; devious Enigma code and airily dismisses the theories of team leader Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode), while defying the orders of Army Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) by going directly to Winston Churchill. A marathoner as well as a mathematician, Turing is the lonely long-distance runner who intellectually laps his colleagues while insisting on making all the crucial decisions. Why? &#8220;Because no one else can.&#8221; They are merely clever; he is brilliant. And in wartime, when results trump politesse, brilliance wins.<\/p>\n<p>On its bright face, The Imitation Game, written by Graham Moore and directed by Morten Tyldum, fits into that cozy genre of tortured-genius biopics that sprout like kudzu just in time for the Oscars. But that&#8217;s not fair to the film, which outthinks and outplays other examples of the genre (The King&#8217;s Speech, The Theory of Everything) just as Turing outraced those around him. For this is a superhero movie of the mind. Unlike the Marvel troupe, whose skills are physical and endlessly watchable, Turing makes magic in his head. The beautiful wheels spin inside; that&#8217;s where he flies. And he defeats the villains of unsolvable equations not with a punch but with a keypunch. The &#8220;action&#8221; here is Turing tinkering with his machine. Or simply thinking&#8211;which, as Cumberbatch portrays it, is adventure of the highest order.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3596961\"><\/div>\n<p>The actor doesn&#8217;t play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation; that&#8217;s your job. He recognizes that this supernal machine had a flaw, or thought it did. Turing&#8217;s Achilles heel was his heart, and his shielding his sexuality from his colleagues helps explain his emotional reticence, as the bullying he suffered at school almost justifies the pleasure he takes in being top dog at Bletchley Park. He even proposes marriage to the Enigma team&#8217;s one woman, Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), as a cover for homosexual activities that were illegal in Britain throughout his life, and the penalties for which hastened his death. This superhero is really a tragic hero, doomed not by his &#8220;crime&#8221; but by society&#8217;s ignorant prejudice.<\/p>\n<p>Critics won&#8217;t need a Turing machine to pick one of the most smartly judged, truly feeling movies of the year or its most towering, magnetic performance. And though the star&#8217;s achievement should be its own reward, he is sure to receive many prizes this Oscar season. He deserves a Cumberbatch of them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3594876\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"
