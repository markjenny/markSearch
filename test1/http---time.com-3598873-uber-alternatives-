    <p>For those crying foul this week over Uber&#8217;s <a href="http://time.com/3595025/uber-data/" target="_blank">violation of user privacy</a> and <a href="https://time.com/3595318/uber-sexism-tech-delete-app/" target="_blank">alleged sexism</a>, there&#8217;s a growing list of alternatives &#8211; that is, if you live in a major U.S. city.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2008, Uber, the dominant ride-sharing service, has spread to 122 cities of the at least 147 U.S. cities with taxi alternatives provided by ride-sharing companies. Uber faces no major competitor in 57 of those cities.</p>
<p>But Uber&#8217;s three major competitors &#8211; Lyft, Curb and Sidecar &#8211; are catching up. By coverage, Lyft appears to be Uber&#8217;s chief rival, with drivers in roughly half as many cities. In three cities, Lyft faces no major rival while Curb operates in 13 cities without a major competitor. Seven cities are now home to all four competitors: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago, Charlotte, Seattle and Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p>Cities are taken from <a href="http://www.side.cr/" target="_blank">Sidecar</a>, <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-US/cities/" target="_blank">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/cities" target="_blank">Lyft</a> and <a href="http://gocurb.com/cities/" target="_blank">Curb</a> websites, and manually edited where different names were used for the same geographic area.</p>
<p>This post was updated on Nov 21 with new cities provided by Lyft.</p>

Seven cities are now home to all four competitors: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Chicago, Charlotte, Seattle and Washington, D.C.<\/p>\n<p>Click on the company labels to show cities with that company.<\/p>\n<div id=\"uber\" class=\"time-interactive\"><img src=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/wp\/interactives\/apps\/uber\/screenshot.png\" class=\"screenshot\" style=\"width:100%;\"><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cities are taken from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.side.cr\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sidecar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/en-US\/cities\/\" target=\"_blank\">Uber<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lyft.com\/cities\" target=\"_blank\">Lyft<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/gocurb.com\/cities\/\" target=\"_blank\">Curb<\/a> websites, and manually edited where different names were used for the same geographic area.<\/p>\n<p>This post was updated on Nov 21 with new cities provided by Lyft.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=See%20Where%20Uber%20Faces%20the%20Biggest%20Competition%20%7C%20TIME&body=See%20Where%20Uber%20Faces%20the%20Biggest%20Competition%0A%0AItching%20to%20ditch%20the%20ride-sharing%20app%3F%20Your%20alternatives%20are%20limited%20but%20growing%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598873%2Fuber-alternatives%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598873%2Fuber-alternatives%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6el&text=Saying%20goodbye%20to%20Uber%3F%20See%20where%20your%20options%20are&via=Techland\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598873%2Fuber-alternatives%2F&title=See+Where+Uber+Faces+the+Biggest+Competition\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3598873\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3598873\/uber-alternatives\/\" data-title=\"See Where Uber Faces the Biggest Competition\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tech\/","description":"Technology news, reviews, how-to's and analysis of smartphones, tablets, computers, apps, video games, streaming media, innovation, social networks and more"},"tags":"Transportation","id":3598873,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598873%2Fuber-alternatives%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6el","encoded_title":"See+Where+Uber+Faces+the+Biggest+Competition","twitter_text":"Saying%20goodbye%20to%20Uber%3F%20See%20where%20your%20options%20are","twitter_via":"Techland","subjects":[null],"ads":{"neg":"false","post_title":"See Where Uber Faces the Biggest Competition"},"Partner_Module":{"partner":"Select","post_title":"See Where Uber Faces the Biggest Competition"},"email_title":"See%20Where%20Uber%20Faces%20the%20Biggest%20Competition%20%7C%20TIME","email_body":"See%20Where%20Uber%20Faces%20the%20Biggest%20Competition%0A%0AItching%20to%20ditch%20the%20ride-sharing%20app%3F%20Your%20alternatives%20are%20limited%20but%20growing%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598873%2Fuber-alternatives%2F","omniture":{"modules":"rr-share"},"outbrain":{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3598873\/uber-alternatives\/","widget_id":"AR_6","hide":false},"scripts":["http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/wp\/interactives\/apps\/uber\/script-min.js"]},"latest":{"articles":[{"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3600463\/immigration-reform-obama-executive-actions\/","right_now":true,"shortlink":"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f6DZ","title":"Obama Touts Immigration Actions in Las Vegas","friendly_title":"Obama Touts Immigration Actions in Las Vegas","post_type":"post","available":true,"time_article":true,"comments_allowed":true,"short_title":"Obama Ups the Ante in Vegas","excerpt":"Raucuous crowd in Las Vegas cheers \"Si, se puede\"","format":"video","modified_time":{"pretty":"Nov. 21, 2014 5:35 PM","published":"2014-11-21 17:36:36","updated":"2014-11-21 22:36:36","minute":"5:01 pm","short":"11\/21"},"authors":[{"id":207012220,"url":"http:\/\/time.com\/author\/zeke-j-miller\/","name":"Zeke J Miller","bio":"Zeke Miller is a political reporter for TIME.

And if the votes hadn&rsquo;t been there, then we would have had to start over, but at least give it a shot. And he didn&rsquo;t do it. And the fact that a year-and-a-half has gone by means that time has been wasted&mdash;and during that time families have been separated, and during that time businesses have been harmed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Obama said lawmakers who question his authority to act have a simple recourse: passing a comprehensive immigration bill for his signature. &#8220;When members of Congress question my authority to make our immigration system work better, I have a simple answer: pass a bill,&#8221; Obama said as the audience cheered and chanted &#8220;Si, se puede.&#8221; &#8220;Pass a bill. Pass a bill. Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600463\"><\/div>\n<p>Before deplaning Air Force One, Obama signed two memoranda to develop policies to better help integrate immigrants into the United States and improve the immigration visa system. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security released memoranda on efforts to improve border security, end the controversial &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; program and employ prosecutorial discretion to allowing many illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. &#8220;Under this revised policy, those who entered illegally prior to January 1, 2014, who never disobeyed a prior order of removal, and were never convicted of a serious offense, will not be priorities for removal,&#8221; the department said of a policy that will take effect on Jan. 5, 2015. DHS also announced that it would begin accepting applications within the next 180 day for the expanded deferred action program, which would allow millions of immigrants to remain in the U.S. legally for three years on a renewable basis.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said he understood the worries of those concerned about the impact of immigration on their jobs and the &#8220;fabric of our country,&#8221; but said he also heard the concerns of the so-called Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and of the American citizens with family members who immigrated illegally to be near them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American dream,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re a nation that finds a way to welcome them. We make them earn it, but we welcome them in as fellow human beings, fellow children of God, and we harness their talents to make the future brighter for everybody.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The executive actions put pressure on Republicans who have strenuously objected to Obama&#8217;s process, while the substance of his announcements places the GOP in a bind with an ever-more-diverse presidential electorate.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600463\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Obama%20Touts%20Immigration%20Actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20%7C%20TIME&body=Obama%20Touts%20Immigration%20Actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas%0A%0ARaucuous%20crowd%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20cheers%20%22Si%2C%20se%20puede%22%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6DZ&text=Obama%20touts%20immigration%20actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F&title=Obama+Touts+Immigration+Actions+in+Las+Vegas\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600463\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600463\/immigration-reform-obama-executive-actions\/\" data-title=\"Obama Touts Immigration Actions in Las Vegas\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Hill, who alleges that as an actress on Cosby&rsquo;s educational television segments, <em>Picture Pages, <\/em>in the &rsquo;80s, she was drugged and suspects that she was sexually assaulted by Cosby starting when she was 15. Hill says that at the age, she began an on-again, off-again relationship with Cosby, who would offer her drinks that Hill now believes were drugged.<\/p>\n<div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"body-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"main-white\">\n<section class=\"page-columns\">\n<section class=\"two-column columns-left\">\n<article id=\"main-story\">\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>&ldquo;One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Hill told<em> CBS Pittsburgh<\/em>. &ldquo;I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned, you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hill eventually ended the relationship when she was 19, despite Cosby paying for Hill&rsquo;s college tuition.<\/p>\n<p>Another woman, Kristina Ruehli, also alleges that she was drugged by Cosby when she was 22, working at a talent agency assistant at Artists Agency Corp, where he was then a client. Ruehli was one of the women named in Andrea Constand&rsquo;s lawsuit against Cosby that was eventually settled.<\/p>\n<p>According to an interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/news\/2014\/11\/21\/kristina-ruehli-says-bill-cosby-drugged-tried-sexually-assault-1965\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Philadelphia Magazine<\/em><\/a>, Cosby invited Ruehli to an after party at his house, who was surprised to find that she was the only guest when she arrived. After drinking the drink that Cosby offered to her, Ruehli found herself disoriented and losing consciousness.<\/p>\n<div class=\"copy-paste-block\">\n<div class=\"copy-paste-block\">\n<p>&ldquo;It was all foggy, and I woke up in the bed. I found myself on the bed, and he had his shirt off. He had unzipped his pants. I was just coming to,&rdquo; Ruehli told <em>Philadelphia Magazine<\/em>. &ldquo;He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head. He had his cock out, and he had my head pushed close enough to it &mdash; I just remember looking at his stomach hair. And the hair on his chest. I had never seen a black man naked before.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Ruehli said that she threw up and left Cosby&rsquo;s house, and decided to come forward to add credibility to the sexual assault allegations that have been growing hour by hour.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need money or aggravation,&rdquo; Ruehli added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very wealthy, so I have nothing to gain. But I wanted to come forward to tell the truth to back up other people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a

its other commercial businesses, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/617568ea-71a1-11e4-9048-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz3JjRZ267l\" target=\"_blank\">according<\/a> to the <em>Financial Times<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Politicians are pushing the European Commission to limit Google&rsquo;s reach either by passing new legislation or through its antitrust investigation into the company, which the EU <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/sep\/08\/european-commission-reopens-google-antitrust-investigation-after-political-storm-over-proposed-settlement\" target=\"_blank\">recently reopened<\/a>. A draft of a parliament motion that FT viewed argues that &ldquo;unbundling [of] search engines from other commercial services&rdquo; could be one appropriate path to curbing the Internet company&rsquo;s dominance.<\/p>\n<p>The expected recommendation, which FT says is backed by the parliament&rsquo;s Socialist and European People&rsquo;s Party political groups, would represent the most extreme action proposed to date by European regulators concerned over how much control American companies have over the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>A vote on the recommendation is expected early next week, FT reports.<\/p>\n<p>A Google spokesman declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/21\/european-parliament-google-break-up\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=European%20Parliament%20Wants%20to%20Break%20Up%20Google%20%7C%20TIME&body=European%20Parliament%20Wants%20to%20Break%20Up%20Google%0A%0AEuropean%20Parliament%20reportedly%20set%20to%20call%20for%20a%20break-up%20of%20the%20tech%20giant%E2%80%99s%20search%20engine%20from%20some%20of%20its%20other%20commercial%20businesses%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600427%2Feurope-google%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600427%2Feurope-google%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6Dp&text=European%20Parliament%20wants%20to%20break%20up%20Google&via=Techland\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600427%2Feurope-google%2F&title=European+Parliament+Wants+to+Break+Up+Google\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600427\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600427\/europe-google\/\" data-title=\"European Parliament Wants to Break Up Google\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Tech","slug":"tech","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tech\/","description":"Technology news, reviews, how-to's and analysis of smartphones, tablets, computers, apps, video games, streaming media, innovation, social networks and more"},"tag":{"name":"Companies","slug":"companies","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/companies\/"},"tags":"Companies|Google","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/google.jpg?crop=589px%2C79px%2C1828px%2C1828px&resize=100%2C100","src":{"small":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/google.jpg?w=280","small_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/google.jpg?w=560","large":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/google.jpg?w=550","large_2x":"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/google.jpg?w=1100"},"credit":"Bloomberg\/Getty Images","caption":"Signage is displayed outside the Google Inc. headquarters in Mountain View, California, on Oct. 13, 2010.

Meanwhile, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, further boosted global investors&rsquo; confidence by saying the central bank is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/11\/21\/markets-usa-bonds-idUSL2N0TB2EZ20141121\" target=\"_blank\">prepared to step up efforts<\/a> to give the struggling eurozone economy a much-needed shot in the arm.<\/p>\n<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 91 points, or 0.5%, to finish at a new record close of 17,810. The blue-chip index, which also set a new intraday high by flirting with the 17,900-point mark, hit a record close two out of five days this week after recording new all-time high finishes three times last week.<\/p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 also posted another record close Friday by rising almost 11 points, or 0.5%, to 2,064. It was the closely-watched index&rsquo;s third record finish of the week after posting three new records last week, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite was up slightly, gaining 11 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 4,713. The tech-heavy index continues to climb to its highest levels since 2000.<\/p>\n<p>One of Friday&rsquo;s best-performing stocks was auction house Sotheby&rsquo;s, which jumped nearly 7% following news of its <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/21\/sothebys-ceo-steps-down-after-an-extended-activist-investor-battle\/\" target=\"_blank\">CEO&rsquo;s departure<\/a> after a long battle with activist investors.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, it was a week of moderate gains for the U.S. market. But it did mark the fifth-straight week of positive performance coming on the heels of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/14\/stock-market-fourth-weekly-gain\/\" target=\"_blank\">best four-week stretch<\/a> since 2011. Earlier this week, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/18\/stock-market-record-close-health-care\/\" target=\"_blank\">the markets improved<\/a> on news that Japan&rsquo;s prime minister would delay tax hikes for 18 months in the hopes of stimulating that country&rsquo;s sluggish economy.<\/p>\n<p>The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 were both up by about 1% on the week, while the Nasdaq gained just 0.5% over the past five days.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the major indices has rebounded sharply after a series of market-wide sell-offs in early October <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/10\/dow-jones-down-volatile-three-weeks\/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly erased<\/a> all of the year&rsquo;s gains as investors showed their concerns over the global

themselves insisting that the former Secretary of State&rsquo;s ascendancy should not be considered &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; while at other moments they discussed in great detail the organizational structure, fundraising and messaging efforts that are already in place to buttress her 2016 campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez said that ambivalence as a result of the pummeling Clinton&rsquo;s campaign received six years ago, when many Democrats considered her a shoo-in as the Democratic nominee.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 2008, we got eviscerated by a better campaign on the ground,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Lessons have been learned. So there has been extraordinary preparation and it&rsquo;s a very, very different, far more sophisticated operation that&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s ready for her, should she decide to run.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Adam Parkhomenko, who founded the organizational group Ready for Hillary, which has spent the last two years collecting a database of roughly 3 million supporters, echoed the sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been doing this since January 2013 if I thought she was inevitable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We learned in 2008 she&rsquo;s not inevitable. No one&rsquo;s inevitable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie Schriock, the head of EMILY&rsquo;s List, who is expected to play a major role in a future Clinton campaign, said she looks forward to a &ldquo;healthy primary.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As everyone goes through a presidential primary process, it&rsquo;ll be the candidate who make the case,&rdquo; she said, adding that Clinton, while clearly the front-runner, will not be immune to that process. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing inevitable about 2016.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600300\"><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, several Clinton backers, including Schriock, former Obama campaign organizer Mitch Stewart, Correct the Record&#8217;s David Brock, and political strategist Chris Lehane, spoke directly about what organizations would have to work together on the ground to make a 2016 Clinton campaign most effective, what issues Clinton would be most likely to emphasize, and what message the campaign would be built around. All agreed that a hypothetical Clinton campaign will likely to focus on working class voters, who are feeling increasingly marginalized in today&rsquo;s economy.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton must project a vision for &ldquo;economic opportunity for American families,&rdquo; said Schriock. That&rsquo;s a phrase she used, with slight variations, twice more during a half-hour talk with reporters. The campaign will likely focus on connecting with working class voters, women, Hispanics and the African American community over issues like equal pay, minimum wage and leveling the playing field for the middle class, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Nina Turner, an Ohio state senator, said that a Clinton campaign could easily motivate key voting blocs, like the African American community, by staking progressive positions on issues like prison reform or creating more economic opportunities for the working poor. But, she said, &ldquo;This is not about a coronation for anybody.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Stewart agreed that &ldquo;a hypothetical Clinton campaign&rdquo; would have to focus primarily economic issues. &ldquo;We have to come up with an economic message that shows working class voters that we&rsquo;re on their side,&rdquo; said Stewart.<\/p>\n<p>When asked what issues would put Clinton in the strongest position against other potential Democratic contenders, such Martin O&#8217;Malley, Bernie Sanders, or Jim Webb, who announced yesterday that he was exploring the possibility of running, Stewart demurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to comment on any hypothetical candidate,&rdquo; said Stewart, laughing. &ldquo;Except my specific hypothetical candidate.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600300\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Hillary%E2%80%99s%202016%20Campaign%20is%20Ready%2C%20Hypothetically%20Speaking%20%7C%20TIME&body=Hillary%E2%80%99s%202016%20Campaign%20is%20Ready%2C%20Hypothetically%20Speaking%0A%0AWould-be%20surrogates%20tried%20to%20make%20the%20case%20for%20Hillary%20without%20admitting%20she%27s%20running%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6Bm&text=Hillary%27s%202016%20campaign%20is%20ready%2C%20hypothetically%20speaking&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F&title=Hillary%E2%80%99s+2016+Campaign+is+Ready%2C+Hypothetically+Speaking\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600300\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600300\/hillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary\/\" data-title=\"Hillary&amp;#8217;s 2016 Campaign is Ready, Hypothetically Speaking\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.<\/p>\n<p>The House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week. Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel. The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May.<\/p>\n<p>The attacks in Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, and two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. A Libyan extremist, Ahmed Abu Khatalla, is facing trial on murder charges after he was captured in Libya and taken to the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to &#8220;stand down&#8221; after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600698\"><\/div>\n<p>The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents, reviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings,&#8221; said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the committee&#8217;s chairman, and Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the ranking Democrat, in a joint statement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from Benghazi and Tripoli as well as eight security personnel on the ground in Benghazi that night. Based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed, we concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their actions saved lives,&#8221; they said.<\/p>\n<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who serves on the intelligence panel and the Benghazi select committee, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s my hope that this report will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and answered yet again, and that the Benghazi Select Committee will accept these findings and instead focus its attention on the State Department&#8217;s progress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our fast response capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of the harshest charges have been leveled at Rice, now Obama&#8217;s national security adviser, who represented the Obama administration on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the attack. Rice repeated talking points that wrongly described a protest over a video deemed offensive to Muslims.<\/p>\n<p>But Rice&#8217;s comments were based on faulty intelligence from multiple agencies, according to the report. Analysts received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi, the report said &mdash;14 from the Open Source Center, which reviews news reports; one from the CIA; two from the Defense Department; and four from the National Security Agency.<\/p>\n<p>In the years since, some participants in the attack have said they were motivated by the video. The attackers were a mix of extremists and hangers on, the investigation found.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To this day,&#8221; the report said, &#8220;significant intelligence gaps regarding the identities, affiliations and motivations of the attackers remain.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600698\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories%20%7C%20TIME&body=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6HM&text=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F&title=House+Intel+Panel+Debunks+Many+Benghazi+Theories\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600698\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600698\/house-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories\/\" data-title=\"House Intel Panel Debunks Many Benghazi Theories\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

But the results, published online today in the<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/em>, show that <strong>the mobile phone data were better at predicting friendship than the subjects themselves.<\/strong> Thirty-two pairs of subjects switched from calling each other acquaintances to friends in the traditionally gathered survey data. These are most likely new relationships that formed during the course of the study, say the researchers, and they left a clear signal in the mobile phone data. Friends call each other far more often than acquaintances do when they are off-campus and during weekends. <strong>The pattern is so distinct that the researchers spotted budding friendships in the phone data months before the people themselves called themselves friends.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another great <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748704547604576263261679848814.html\" target=\"_blank\">article<\/a> in the WSJ by Robert Lee Hotz about how scientists are using phone data to study our behavior &mdash; and learning more than they ever thought they could:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&hellip;at MIT, scientists who tracked student cellphones during the latest presidential election were able to deduce that two people were talking about politics, even though the researchers didn&rsquo;t know the content of the conversation. By analyzing changes in movement and communication patterns, researchers could also detect flu symptoms before the students themselves realized they were getting sick.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Phones can know,&rdquo; said Dr. Pentland, director of MIT&rsquo;s Human Dynamics Laboratory, who helped pioneer the research. &ldquo;People can get this god&rsquo;s-eye view of human behavior.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, companies are very interested in this data:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Cellphone providers are openly exploring other possibilities. <strong>By mining their calling records for social relationships among customers, several European telephone companies discovered that people were five times more likely to switch carriers if a friend had already switched, said Mr. Eagle, who works with the firms. The companies now selectively target people for special advertising based on friendships with people who dropped the service.<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600178\"><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<p>And some of the results are downright unnerving:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>After analyzing more than 16 million records of call date, time and position, the researchers determined that, taken together, people&rsquo;s movements appeared to follow a mathematical pattern.<\/strong> <em><strong>The scientists said that, with enough information about past movements, they could forecast someone&rsquo;s future whereabouts with 93.6% accuracy.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The pattern held true whether people stayed close to home or traveled widely, and wasn&rsquo;t affected by the phone user&rsquo;s age or gender.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A few other interesting tidbits:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Overall, our phones <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakadesuyo.com\/does-technology-make-us-more-or-less-happy\" target=\"_blank\">make us happier<\/a>.

Twelve pieces are on display right now at the Kreeger Museum in Washington, D.C., including my all-time favorite, &#8220;Lament.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So the road started early for me. Telling stories. Communicating a message. Developing my voice in this evolving medium over the course of more than two decades. Sometimes there is no way to take a different path when it is what you love &mdash; even when it doesn&#8217;t love you back.<\/p>\n<p>I trudged through 10 years in local news, worked overnights at CBS News for four years, hosted a cable show for women for two years after that until finally settling into what I thought would be a life-long career as a correspondent for CBS News. My first week on the job was 9\/11. I traveled America finding stories for &#8220;The CBS Evening News,&#8221; &#8220;CBS Sunday Morning,&#8221; even &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; Anchoring the CBS Evening News Sunday edition felt like a feather in my cap.<\/p>\n<p>Just shy of my 40th birthday, the road ended. I was called down to the office of the President of CBS News and was told, &#8220;They were moving in a different direction.&#8221; I was being fired. I. Was. Fired. They liked my work&hellip; but didn&#8217;t like it anymore&hellip; or just had other people coming in&#8230; Whatever it was, my days at CBS News had abruptly come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Being fired is an out-of-body experience. I remember it like it was yesterday. A mixture of anger, feeling victimized, feeling exhilarated and free, and feeling scared shitless all at once. But then the time starts to pass, and if you are like I was, the NEXT job couldn&#8217;t come soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>I sent my work to other networks and the response was&hellip; crickets. I went from everything to everyone to nothing to no one. If I did get an interview, the first question was: Why were you fired? I didn&#8217;t have an answer because I didn&#8217;t really know. Each job interview set me deeper back; deeper into knowing it was over. It&#8217;s hard to fight nothing. No phone ringing. No calls back. Just &#8220;No thank you,&#8221; from everywhere I applied. I would re-apply six months later. Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I did get an audition to anchor the local news at the ABC affiliate in Washington. I was told I was close&#8230; down to three. I went for the audition and was desperate for the job. So desperate it was written all over my face. They gave it to the talented Alison Starling who is still there to this day.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600691\"><\/div>\n<p>At about nine months of nothing, with severance running out, I knew I had to find another road. I began the task of applying for any job anywhere. I was overqualified for many jobs I applied for online, but still got no calls. Slowly&#8230; ever so slowly, I got responses from a few major PR firms. One, just one, called me in for an interview. I had the skills and the experience to do PR well.<\/p>\n<p>It was at this time that a good friend &mdash; a talented producer at CBS News &mdash; was in the process of getter fired too (or &#8220;released from her contract&#8221;). The turnover was continuing there and this time, it was my friend&#8217;s turn. Since I had been through it, I was coaching her through the process &mdash; the hurt, the anger, the loss, the fear. I was reliving it all with her. Knowing the place and the players, it really was like my loss all over again. She was one of the best producers there and had taught me everything I know about voice control, studio tracking and storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>My job interview turned into another one until it was down to a final round. A job as a VP at a major PR firm. Real money. It was the kind of money that would keep the family moving forward. We were at a dead stop with no hope in sight. This job was a potential lifeline&hellip; right there for the taking.<\/p>\n<p>I was waiting for the call to line up the last round. I&#8217;ll never forget the moment. Driving my pickup up the hill near my house, the &#8217;93 Ford 150 with roll-up windows just stopped&hellip; Stalled out and died. I knew that meant another $500 at the shop. $500 that I did not have. Then my cell phone rings. It&#8217;s the PR firm. Wanting to know if I can come in this week&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>I put the truck in park in the middle of the road and listened to myself as I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to come in but I have to be honest; I know someone better for the job. Perfect actually.&#8221; I then began to sing the praises of my soon-to-be fired friend. It came out of my mouth as if I had been practicing it forever&hellip; So easy to say, because it was true. She was perfect for the job, and I was not. I knew this road, as much as I needed one, would not be taken by me.<\/p>\n<p>I remember clunking my head on the steering wheel after I hung up asking myself: &#8220;Why, WHY?? You need a job so badly!&#8221; But I knew it even then. There was still only one road for me&hellip; and that this one wasn&#8217;t it. I knew even then I would have to find my way back to that road I chose at 13 years old. Somehow.<\/p>\n<p>It took many more months, but I called every network known to man and begged for ANY job they had available.

A Black American woman. I would be so jealous if I were anything else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I learned that &ldquo;Black&rdquo; was intended to mean &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; at the age of five and by the time I was ready for college I had only begun to learn why I should rejoice in my Blackness. I grew up in this spirit. I survived being &ldquo;the smart Black girl&rdquo; at majority white schools in this spirit, and rejected an opportunity for full scholarship at a predominately white institution to attend the best university on the globe (naturally a historically black one) &#8212; because of this spirit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Being a Black person at an HBCU is nothing short of divine. A community of academics who understand you, instructors who are exceptionally hard on you because they know what you&rsquo;re up against in this world, and an ever-present aura that dispels every negative thing that you were taught about your color from the moment you knew what it was.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I chopped off my chemically processed hair, took every class I could led by the master of Africana Studies, Dr. Gregory Carr, and wore an ankh on my body every chance I got.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Needless to say, I only dated Black men.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I find Black men physically attractive, what I really, really find attractive is the unspoken understanding that exists between me and a Black man of my choosing. I love not explaining why I tie my hair up at night, or that my skin would burn in beach sun without sunblock. I love arguing about whether &ldquo;Love Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love and Basketball&rdquo; was the greatest Black love story of the &rsquo;90s. I could never date outside of Black men, I thought. It would never work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But I was W-R-O-N-G! I could and I did.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">We&rsquo;ll call him Mazzi for discretion&rsquo;s sake. He stood about 6 feet and 5 inches. He was handsome, funny, and a bit cynical. We worked in the same space, after I had graduated from college, for about a year. I hardly noticed him at the onset but eventually we began talking and sharing inside jokes and such. And one day he asked me on a date.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">There was naturally some apprehension: 1) because we worked together AND 2) because he was unquestionably a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I expressed my desire to keep it quiet at work and Mazzi agreed, so we went.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I laughed a lot that evening. Like from pick-up to drop-off. As our dates went on for some months, I began to notice the disapproving eyes of people around us when we were out together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Do you see how people look at us?!&rdquo; I asked one day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said nonchalantly. &ldquo;It happens all the time. People don&rsquo;t have shit going on in their own lives so that fact that I&rsquo;m here with this &lsquo;self-aware&rsquo; Black woman is earth shattering to them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He smiled cautiously.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Time passed and we grew closer. I had just gotten into running and he was a thrower for his college&rsquo;s track team so he would offer me advice on what I can do to get faster and stronger (he also gave awesome back rubs). He was a writer who never put his thoughts down and I encouraged him to do so. He had become my sounding board when I would get overwhelmed and met disappointments in my medical school application process, and I was his &ldquo;therapist&rdquo; who eventually got to the root of his cynicism. We were comfortable with one another. At some point in all this, I changed jobs to work in my field and we no longer had the &ldquo;work thing&rdquo; to consider.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600604\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Here I was: Ms. HBCU, Afro-turned locs sporting, ankh wearing, and lover of all things Black &mdash; falling for a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">He brought up the subject of a relationship and I retreated. I&rsquo;d talk about my reluctance to get in relationships (which was true) and he didn&rsquo;t push the issue. But of course eventually I entered a relationship with him because it only made sense.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My two closest friends were shocked but very supportive and liked him a lot. I liked him too. He was the ideal, except he wasn&rsquo;t Black.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My family slowly began to pick up on the fact that this was more than a collection of dates and did not necessarily approve. This didn&rsquo;t impact me so much though. I was good at being rebellious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">His family was really sweet to me and always invited and included me when going to dinners or family parties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I never felt &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; throughout the course of our relationship, race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I remember the first time it was brought to my attention. He was driving and talking to me on the phone with some friends in the car. His friends had been drinking one of them yelled into the phone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Tell Ashley I miss her! Wait! Do Black people miss people?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Now you and I both know how idiotic of a statement that was, but my issue was not with his asshole of a friend, it was with his lack of response to the comment. He later told me he addressed it. I didn&rsquo;t believe him.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">When I would experience &ldquo;exotic otherness&rdquo; at work, I would talk to him about it and he would suggest that I was overreacting when I knew I wasn&rsquo;t. He would never know the feeling I was describing and I really couldn&rsquo;t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/issues\/white-privilege-ferguson\"> expect him to understand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Then once in an argument, he said that my beloved alma mater was &ldquo;institutionally racist.&rdquo; This was a HUGE mistake on his part. I don&rsquo;t remember my exact response but I am certain it was angry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">These were tough issues we had to work through. And it was hard. In considering a future with him, I worried about these issues. And he got to a point where he would refuse to talk if he sensed that race would come up. I understood, it was tense between us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But when it was good, which usually was the case, it was perfect. Then, during a period that I thought was a good one, he went through my phone while I was sleeping. He read messages between my friends and me about how I missed the comfort and familiarity of Black men&#8230; OUCH!<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">To know me is to know that a violation of my privacy is grounds for dismissal. I felt guilty, so I didn&rsquo;t break up with him right way. But from that point forward, I stopped feeling like myself. I was no longer mentally present in the relationship and I strongly resented the phone incident. The race thing was too hard and I had stopped &ldquo;trying&rdquo; because I knew he didn&rsquo;t trust me anyway. I ended it a few months later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">This was in August. And I would be fooling myself if I said I don&rsquo;t sometimes think I made a mistake.

In the U.S., it was &#8220;the worst time to be queer because you are not being ignored, you are actively searched for and persecuted,&#8221; said John D&#8217;Emilio, a professor of gay and lesbian studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &#8220;The nice thing about the movie is that it is calling attention to this bit of history that people don&rsquo;t know anything about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596955\/the-price-of-genius\/\" target=\"_blank\">The price of genius<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In Britain&mdash;where America&#8217;s own sodomy laws originated&mdash;the story begins in 1533, during the reign of Henry the VIII. That year, the Buggery Act made male sex a capital offense in Britain, punishable by death, usually by hanging. That remained the law until 1861, when the sentence was changed from death to prison, usually with hard labor. In 1885, the law was broadened to criminalize &#8220;gross indecency&#8221; a vague, catch-all term used to prosecute anything considered to be deviant sexual behavior outside of sodomy, mostly between men. In 1895, the playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years of prison and hard labor, about which he penned a poem called &#8220;The Balad of Reading Gaol.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During Alan Turing&#8217;s life, public concern over the possibility that homosexuals serving in the military or aiding in the war effort could be blackmailed by enemies intensified the stigma of homosexuality in Britain. After Turing was convicted in 1952, the British government took away his security clearance. Turing was exposed after he reported a petty theft to the police, involving his lover. Their relationship was discovered by the police through his reporting of the crime. He pleaded guilty and opted for hormone treatments, known as chemical castration, instead of prison time. He tragically killed himself with cyanide in 1954.<\/p>\n<p>The 1950s, was the beginning of the end for Britain&#8217;s laws against homosexual sex, as the prosecution of prominent people stoked a public backlash against the laws. In 1954, a well known journalist, Peter Wildeblood was convicted of homosexual acts with two prominent and wealthy men, Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, in a public trial that resulted in prison time for all of the men and public opposition to laws against homosexual sex. The trial lead to the creation of the Wolfenden committee of government representatives, ministers, educators, and psychiatrists, which in 1957, published a report recommending the discontinuation of laws against homosexuality.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599607\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3594876\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>The report eventually led to the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, which ended the criminalization of homosexual sex between consenting men over the age of 21 in Britain and Wales. In 1994, the age was lowered to 18, and in 2003, it was lowered to 16, the same age for consenting heterosexual sex.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. history is slightly different from Britain&#8217;s. The fervent prosecution of gay sex didn&#8217;t start to happen in earnest until the very period during which Turing lived. The U.S. had anti-sodomy laws inherited from the English settlers, but it wasn&#8217;t until the late 1930s, 40s and 50s, during a period coinciding with the World Wars and a strong strain of Christian morality, that police in the U.S. made it a priority to enforce laws against homosexuals.<\/p>\n<p>As in England, concerns that homosexuals could be blackmailed by Communist spies&mdash;an idea popularized by Senator Joe McCarthy&mdash;drove some of the fervor against homosexuals during that period. In the U.S.&mdash;more so than in Britain, it seems&mdash;the period was marked by increased police enforcement of the laws. Police officers went undercover in public parks where homosexuals went to meet each other for sexual encounters, in order to uncover them. It was a period of fear for homosexuals in America unparalleled before or since. &#8220;This is the height of what I call the homosexual terror in America,&#8221; said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of<em> Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596961\/review-the-imitation-game\/\" target=\"_blank\">TIME reviews <em>The Imitation Game<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>During this same period, Eskridge said, states began to pass laws that allowed courts to institutionalize gay people indefinitely in mental institutions for having &#8220;psychotic personalities,&#8221; where were experimented on, lobotomized, and given shock therapy.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case with Turing, the prosecution of gays also denied the U.S. some very bright minds who, but for their homosexuality, might have been allowed to contribute more to society. In the late 1950&#8242;s, Frank Kameny, an astronomer with a Ph.D. from Harvard, was kicked out of the Army Map Service and barred from serving in theUS government because he was a homosexual.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of geniuses of 20th century, the father of modern computers who helped win World War II, who was a lovely person, was destroyed by the anti homosexual terror,&#8221; Eskridge said of Turing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3558879\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%20%7C%20TIME&body=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%0A%0AAlan%20Turing%20wasn%27t%20the%20only%20one%20who%20suffered%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6qb&text=The%20history%20behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%27s%20The%20Imitation%20Game&via=TIMEHistory\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F&title=The+History+Behind+Benedict+Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s+The+Imitation+Game\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3599607\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599607\/imitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing\/\" data-title=\"The History Behind Benedict Cumberbatch&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;\/i&gt;\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"History","slug":"history","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/history\/","description":"The news in context, from the archives of TIME.

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.<\/p>\n<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?<\/p>\n<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2014\/11\/19\/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">decided there was not sufficient evidence<\/a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/articles\/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde\/\">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde<\/a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599631\"><\/div>\n<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know<\/em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.<\/p>\n<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.<\/p>\n<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission.

His office pointed to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/remarks-president-comprehensive-immigration-reform\">2010 Obama statement<\/a> in which the President said that providing undocumented workers legal status &ldquo;could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The action by the President yesterday will only encourage more people to come here illegally and put their lives at risk,&rdquo; said Boehner. &ldquo;We saw the humanitarian crisis on our border last summer&mdash;how horrific it was. Well next summer, it could be worse.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Boehner was referring to a surge in unaccompanied minors from October 2013 through September, when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/newsroom\/stats\/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children-2014\">over 68,000<\/a> unaccompanied minors crossed the southwest border, a 77% increase over the previous year. (The number of children coming over has sharply declined in the past few months.)<\/p>\n<p>But Doris Meissner, the director of the Migration Policy Institute&#8217;s immigration policy work, said that Boehner&#8217;s criticism was off. Here&#8217;s what she told TIME:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It goes to the more general idea of whether a legal status program functions as a magnet to future illegal immigration and that&rsquo;s always something that&rsquo;s been out there and has been a concern, but the reality today is that we have invested so much in southwest border enforcement&hellip;and the President has underscored that again that he is going to allocate even more additional resources to border enforcement. The evidence that we have is that our illegal immigration across the southwest border is at it&rsquo;s lowest level since the early 1970s when the current wave of illegal immigration largely from Mexico began, we have net minus immigration from Mexico.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600239\"><\/div>\n<p>The child migrant spurt that happened over the last year was much more a function of conditions in those three countries&mdash;Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador&mdash;and notion of &#8216;permisos&#8217; in the United States. But that&rsquo;s now really receded dramatically. So if you take the spurt of Central American crossings out of the numbers for last year, you find the lowest levels of illegal immigration apprehensions across the southwest border in decades. Now that&rsquo;s not to say that you can discount Central American migration but&#8230;it&rsquo;s a function of different circumstances then the illegal immigration that has led to what the President is saying now.<\/p>\n<p>This action that he has taken now is retrospective. You have to have been in the country for five years to qualify for it. It&rsquo;s for people as of the date of announcement; there&rsquo;s no eligibility for people that might be coming forward in the future. I do think that the underpinnings today are quite different and it&rsquo;s pretty hard to make the case that this particular action would spur a future migration.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600239\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Obama%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Increase%20Illegal%20Immigration%2C%20Expert%20Says%20%7C%20TIME&body=Obama%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Increase%20Illegal%20Immigration%2C%20Expert%20Says%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6An&text=Obama%27s%20actions%20won%27t%20increase%20illegal%20immigration%2C%20expert%20says.&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F&title=Obama%E2%80%99s+Actions+Won%E2%80%99t+Increase+Illegal+Immigration%2C+Expert+Says\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600239\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600239\/obama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert\/\" data-title=\"Obama&amp;#8217;s Actions Won&amp;#8217;t Increase Illegal Immigration, Expert Says\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>osby Show<\/i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?<\/p>\n<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.<\/p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>harm anyone, even indirectly?<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599978\/cosby-show-reruns-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599394\"><\/div>\n<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son<\/em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596545\/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">silence<\/a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599394\"><\/div><\/aside><aside
