        <h3 class="featured">Leading by Example</h3>
        <div class="excerpt"><p>Welcome to the second class of TIME's Next Generation Leaders series. As part of our ongoing search for leaders of tomorrow who are working hard to change their worlds today we're introducing seven more young people from around the world who have not just succeeded in their fields but have also persuaded others to share their vision. We launched this new program in September after spending several months carefully looking at young people whose achievements in fields such as business, science, activism and sport are matched by their ability to bring others with them as they turn their dreams into reality. These young leaders have already made an impact in their fields but in many respects they are just getting started so we intend to keep writing about them on TIME.com as they develop and thrive. Meanwhile, we have already started looking for the third class of these young leaders and will introduce them to you in the first half of 2015. </p></div>

And if the votes hadn&rsquo;t been there, then we would have had to start over, but at least give it a shot. And he didn&rsquo;t do it. And the fact that a year-and-a-half has gone by means that time has been wasted&mdash;and during that time families have been separated, and during that time businesses have been harmed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Obama said lawmakers who question his authority to act have a simple recourse: passing a comprehensive immigration bill for his signature. &#8220;When members of Congress question my authority to make our immigration system work better, I have a simple answer: pass a bill,&#8221; Obama said as the audience cheered and chanted &#8220;Si, se puede.&#8221; &#8220;Pass a bill. Pass a bill. Nobody is stopping them from passing a bill.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600463\"><\/div>\n<p>Before deplaning Air Force One, Obama signed two memoranda to develop policies to better help integrate immigrants into the United States and improve the immigration visa system. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security released memoranda on efforts to improve border security, end the controversial &#8220;Secure Communities&#8221; program and employ prosecutorial discretion to allowing many illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. &#8220;Under this revised policy, those who entered illegally prior to January 1, 2014, who never disobeyed a prior order of removal, and were never convicted of a serious offense, will not be priorities for removal,&#8221; the department said of a policy that will take effect on Jan. 5, 2015. DHS also announced that it would begin accepting applications within the next 180 day for the expanded deferred action program, which would allow millions of immigrants to remain in the U.S. legally for three years on a renewable basis.<\/p>\n<p>Obama said he understood the worries of those concerned about the impact of immigration on their jobs and the &#8220;fabric of our country,&#8221; but said he also heard the concerns of the so-called Dreamers who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and of the American citizens with family members who immigrated illegally to be near them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not a nation that kicks out strivers and dreamers who want to earn their piece of the American dream,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re a nation that finds a way to welcome them. We make them earn it, but we welcome them in as fellow human beings, fellow children of God, and we harness their talents to make the future brighter for everybody.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The executive actions put pressure on Republicans who have strenuously objected to Obama&#8217;s process, while the substance of his announcements places the GOP in a bind with an ever-more-diverse presidential electorate.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600463\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Obama%20Touts%20Immigration%20Actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20%7C%20TIME&body=Obama%20Touts%20Immigration%20Actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas%0A%0ARaucuous%20crowd%20in%20Las%20Vegas%20cheers%20%22Si%2C%20se%20puede%22%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6DZ&text=Obama%20touts%20immigration%20actions%20in%20Las%20Vegas&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600463%2Fimmigration-reform-obama-executive-actions%2F&title=Obama+Touts+Immigration+Actions+in+Las+Vegas\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600463\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600463\/immigration-reform-obama-executive-actions\/\" data-title=\"Obama Touts Immigration Actions in Las Vegas\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Hill, who alleges that as an actress on Cosby&rsquo;s educational television segments, <em>Picture Pages, <\/em>in the &rsquo;80s, she was drugged and suspects that she was sexually assaulted by Cosby starting when she was 15. Hill says that at the age, she began an on-again, off-again relationship with Cosby, who would offer her drinks that Hill now believes were drugged.<\/p>\n<div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"body-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"main-white\">\n<section class=\"page-columns\">\n<section class=\"two-column columns-left\">\n<article id=\"main-story\">\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>&ldquo;One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Hill told<em> CBS Pittsburgh<\/em>. &ldquo;I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned, you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hill eventually ended the relationship when she was 19, despite Cosby paying for Hill&rsquo;s college tuition.<\/p>\n<p>Another woman, Kristina Ruehli, also alleges that she was drugged by Cosby when she was 22, working at a talent agency assistant at Artists Agency Corp, where he was then a client. Ruehli was one of the women named in Andrea Constand&rsquo;s lawsuit against Cosby that was eventually settled.<\/p>\n<p>According to an interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/news\/2014\/11\/21\/kristina-ruehli-says-bill-cosby-drugged-tried-sexually-assault-1965\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Philadelphia Magazine<\/em><\/a>, Cosby invited Ruehli to an after party at his house, who was surprised to find that she was the only guest when she arrived. After drinking the drink that Cosby offered to her, Ruehli found herself disoriented and losing consciousness.<\/p>\n<div class=\"copy-paste-block\">\n<div class=\"copy-paste-block\">\n<p>&ldquo;It was all foggy, and I woke up in the bed. I found myself on the bed, and he had his shirt off. He had unzipped his pants. I was just coming to,&rdquo; Ruehli told <em>Philadelphia Magazine<\/em>. &ldquo;He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head. He had his cock out, and he had my head pushed close enough to it &mdash; I just remember looking at his stomach hair. And the hair on his chest. I had never seen a black man naked before.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Ruehli said that she threw up and left Cosby&rsquo;s house, and decided to come forward to add credibility to the sexual assault allegations that have been growing hour by hour.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need money or aggravation,&rdquo; Ruehli added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very wealthy, so I have nothing to gain. But I wanted to come forward to tell the truth to back up other people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><a

Meanwhile, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, further boosted global investors&rsquo; confidence by saying the central bank is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/11\/21\/markets-usa-bonds-idUSL2N0TB2EZ20141121\" target=\"_blank\">prepared to step up efforts<\/a> to give the struggling eurozone economy a much-needed shot in the arm.<\/p>\n<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 91 points, or 0.5%, to finish at a new record close of 17,810. The blue-chip index, which also set a new intraday high by flirting with the 17,900-point mark, hit a record close two out of five days this week after recording new all-time high finishes three times last week.<\/p>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 also posted another record close Friday by rising almost 11 points, or 0.5%, to 2,064. It was the closely-watched index&rsquo;s third record finish of the week after posting three new records last week, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite was up slightly, gaining 11 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 4,713. The tech-heavy index continues to climb to its highest levels since 2000.<\/p>\n<p>One of Friday&rsquo;s best-performing stocks was auction house Sotheby&rsquo;s, which jumped nearly 7% following news of its <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/21\/sothebys-ceo-steps-down-after-an-extended-activist-investor-battle\/\" target=\"_blank\">CEO&rsquo;s departure<\/a> after a long battle with activist investors.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, it was a week of moderate gains for the U.S. market. But it did mark the fifth-straight week of positive performance coming on the heels of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/14\/stock-market-fourth-weekly-gain\/\" target=\"_blank\">best four-week stretch<\/a> since 2011. Earlier this week, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/18\/stock-market-record-close-health-care\/\" target=\"_blank\">the markets improved<\/a> on news that Japan&rsquo;s prime minister would delay tax hikes for 18 months in the hopes of stimulating that country&rsquo;s sluggish economy.<\/p>\n<p>The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 were both up by about 1% on the week, while the Nasdaq gained just 0.5% over the past five days.<\/p>\n<p>Each of the major indices has rebounded sharply after a series of market-wide sell-offs in early October <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/10\/10\/dow-jones-down-volatile-three-weeks\/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly erased<\/a> all of the year&rsquo;s gains as investors showed their concerns over the global

themselves insisting that the former Secretary of State&rsquo;s ascendancy should not be considered &ldquo;inevitable,&rdquo; while at other moments they discussed in great detail the organizational structure, fundraising and messaging efforts that are already in place to buttress her 2016 campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez said that ambivalence as a result of the pummeling Clinton&rsquo;s campaign received six years ago, when many Democrats considered her a shoo-in as the Democratic nominee.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 2008, we got eviscerated by a better campaign on the ground,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Lessons have been learned. So there has been extraordinary preparation and it&rsquo;s a very, very different, far more sophisticated operation that&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s ready for her, should she decide to run.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Adam Parkhomenko, who founded the organizational group Ready for Hillary, which has spent the last two years collecting a database of roughly 3 million supporters, echoed the sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been doing this since January 2013 if I thought she was inevitable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We learned in 2008 she&rsquo;s not inevitable. No one&rsquo;s inevitable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie Schriock, the head of EMILY&rsquo;s List, who is expected to play a major role in a future Clinton campaign, said she looks forward to a &ldquo;healthy primary.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As everyone goes through a presidential primary process, it&rsquo;ll be the candidate who make the case,&rdquo; she said, adding that Clinton, while clearly the front-runner, will not be immune to that process. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing inevitable about 2016.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600300\"><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, several Clinton backers, including Schriock, former Obama campaign organizer Mitch Stewart, Correct the Record&#8217;s David Brock, and political strategist Chris Lehane, spoke directly about what organizations would have to work together on the ground to make a 2016 Clinton campaign most effective, what issues Clinton would be most likely to emphasize, and what message the campaign would be built around. All agreed that a hypothetical Clinton campaign will likely to focus on working class voters, who are feeling increasingly marginalized in today&rsquo;s economy.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton must project a vision for &ldquo;economic opportunity for American families,&rdquo; said Schriock. That&rsquo;s a phrase she used, with slight variations, twice more during a half-hour talk with reporters. The campaign will likely focus on connecting with working class voters, women, Hispanics and the African American community over issues like equal pay, minimum wage and leveling the playing field for the middle class, she said.<\/p>\n<p>Nina Turner, an Ohio state senator, said that a Clinton campaign could easily motivate key voting blocs, like the African American community, by staking progressive positions on issues like prison reform or creating more economic opportunities for the working poor. But, she said, &ldquo;This is not about a coronation for anybody.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Stewart agreed that &ldquo;a hypothetical Clinton campaign&rdquo; would have to focus primarily economic issues. &ldquo;We have to come up with an economic message that shows working class voters that we&rsquo;re on their side,&rdquo; said Stewart.<\/p>\n<p>When asked what issues would put Clinton in the strongest position against other potential Democratic contenders, such Martin O&#8217;Malley, Bernie Sanders, or Jim Webb, who announced yesterday that he was exploring the possibility of running, Stewart demurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to comment on any hypothetical candidate,&rdquo; said Stewart, laughing. &ldquo;Except my specific hypothetical candidate.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600300\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Hillary%E2%80%99s%202016%20Campaign%20is%20Ready%2C%20Hypothetically%20Speaking%20%7C%20TIME&body=Hillary%E2%80%99s%202016%20Campaign%20is%20Ready%2C%20Hypothetically%20Speaking%0A%0AWould-be%20surrogates%20tried%20to%20make%20the%20case%20for%20Hillary%20without%20admitting%20she%27s%20running%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6Bm&text=Hillary%27s%202016%20campaign%20is%20ready%2C%20hypothetically%20speaking&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600300%2Fhillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary%2F&title=Hillary%E2%80%99s+2016+Campaign+is+Ready%2C+Hypothetically+Speaking\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600300\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600300\/hillary-clinton-president-2016-ready-for-hillary\/\" data-title=\"Hillary&amp;#8217;s 2016 Campaign is Ready, Hypothetically Speaking\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

The hotels will load their room types, availability and pricing information onto Amazon and pay the company a 15% commission, Skift reports. Hoteliers would receive their payments for the room from Amazon, and could negotiate a lower commission.<\/p>\n<p>One advantage for Amazon is that it could combine information about a traveler&#8217;s

intelligence about who carried it out and why was contradictory, the report found. That led Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to inaccurately assert that the attack had evolved from a protest, when in fact there had been no protest. But it was intelligence analysts, not political appointees, who made the wrong call, the committee found. The report did not conclude that Rice or any other government official acted in bad faith or intentionally misled the American people.<\/p>\n<p>The House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week. Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel. The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May.<\/p>\n<p>The attacks in Benghazi killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, and two CIA contractors, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty. A Libyan extremist, Ahmed Abu Khatalla, is facing trial on murder charges after he was captured in Libya and taken to the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the attacks, Republicans criticized the Obama administration and its then-secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016. People in and out of government have alleged that a CIA response team was ordered to &#8220;stand down&#8221; after the State Department compound came under attack, that a military rescue was nixed, that officials intentionally downplayed the role of al-Qaida figures in the attack, and that Stevens and the CIA were involved in a secret operation to spirit weapons out of Libya and into the hands of Syrian rebels. None of that is true, according to the House Intelligence Committee report.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600698\"><\/div>\n<p>The report did find, however, that the State Department facility where Stevens and Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack. Previous reports have found that requests for security improvements were not acted upon in Washington.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We spent thousands of hours asking questions, poring over documents, reviewing intelligence assessments, reading cables and emails, and held a total of 20 committee events and hearings,&#8221; said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., the committee&#8217;s chairman, and Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the ranking Democrat, in a joint statement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We conducted detailed interviews with senior intelligence officials from Benghazi and Tripoli as well as eight security personnel on the ground in Benghazi that night. Based on the testimony and the documents we reviewed, we concluded that all the CIA officers in Benghazi were heroes. Their actions saved lives,&#8221; they said.<\/p>\n<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who serves on the intelligence panel and the Benghazi select committee, said, &#8220;It&#8217;s my hope that this report will put to rest many of the questions that have been asked and answered yet again, and that the Benghazi Select Committee will accept these findings and instead focus its attention on the State Department&#8217;s progress in securing our facilities around the world and standing up our fast response capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of the harshest charges have been leveled at Rice, now Obama&#8217;s national security adviser, who represented the Obama administration on Sunday talk shows the weekend after the attack. Rice repeated talking points that wrongly described a protest over a video deemed offensive to Muslims.<\/p>\n<p>But Rice&#8217;s comments were based on faulty intelligence from multiple agencies, according to the report. Analysts received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi, the report said &mdash;14 from the Open Source Center, which reviews news reports; one from the CIA; two from the Defense Department; and four from the National Security Agency.<\/p>\n<p>In the years since, some participants in the attack have said they were motivated by the video. The attackers were a mix of extremists and hangers on, the investigation found.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To this day,&#8221; the report said, &#8220;significant intelligence gaps regarding the identities, affiliations and motivations of the attackers remain.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600698\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories%20%7C%20TIME&body=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6HM&text=House%20Intel%20Panel%20Debunks%20Many%20Benghazi%20Theories&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600698%2Fhouse-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories%2F&title=House+Intel+Panel+Debunks+Many+Benghazi+Theories\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600698\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600698\/house-intel-panel-debunks-many-benghazi-theories\/\" data-title=\"House Intel Panel Debunks Many Benghazi Theories\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

But the results, published online today in the<em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/em>, show that <strong>the mobile phone data were better at predicting friendship than the subjects themselves.<\/strong> Thirty-two pairs of subjects switched from calling each other acquaintances to friends in the traditionally gathered survey data. These are most likely new relationships that formed during the course of the study, say the researchers, and they left a clear signal in the mobile phone data. Friends call each other far more often than acquaintances do when they are off-campus and during weekends. <strong>The pattern is so distinct that the researchers spotted budding friendships in the phone data months before the people themselves called themselves friends.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another great <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052748704547604576263261679848814.html\" target=\"_blank\">article<\/a> in the WSJ by Robert Lee Hotz about how scientists are using phone data to study our behavior &mdash; and learning more than they ever thought they could:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&hellip;at MIT, scientists who tracked student cellphones during the latest presidential election were able to deduce that two people were talking about politics, even though the researchers didn&rsquo;t know the content of the conversation. By analyzing changes in movement and communication patterns, researchers could also detect flu symptoms before the students themselves realized they were getting sick.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Phones can know,&rdquo; said Dr. Pentland, director of MIT&rsquo;s Human Dynamics Laboratory, who helped pioneer the research. &ldquo;People can get this god&rsquo;s-eye view of human behavior.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, companies are very interested in this data:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Cellphone providers are openly exploring other possibilities. <strong>By mining their calling records for social relationships among customers, several European telephone companies discovered that people were five times more likely to switch carriers if a friend had already switched, said Mr. Eagle, who works with the firms. The companies now selectively target people for special advertising based on friendships with people who dropped the service.<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600178\"><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<p>And some of the results are downright unnerving:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>After analyzing more than 16 million records of call date, time and position, the researchers determined that, taken together, people&rsquo;s movements appeared to follow a mathematical pattern.<\/strong> <em><strong>The scientists said that, with enough information about past movements, they could forecast someone&rsquo;s future whereabouts with 93.6% accuracy.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The pattern held true whether people stayed close to home or traveled widely, and wasn&rsquo;t affected by the phone user&rsquo;s age or gender.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A few other interesting tidbits:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Overall, our phones <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakadesuyo.com\/does-technology-make-us-more-or-less-happy\" target=\"_blank\">make us happier<\/a>.

Twelve pieces are on display right now at the Kreeger Museum in Washington, D.C., including my all-time favorite, &#8220;Lament.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So the road started early for me. Telling stories. Communicating a message. Developing my voice in this evolving medium over the course of more than two decades. Sometimes there is no way to take a different path when it is what you love &mdash; even when it doesn&#8217;t love you back.<\/p>\n<p>I trudged through 10 years in local news, worked overnights at CBS News for four years, hosted a cable show for women for two years after that until finally settling into what I thought would be a life-long career as a correspondent for CBS News. My first week on the job was 9\/11. I traveled America finding stories for &#8220;The CBS Evening News,&#8221; &#8220;CBS Sunday Morning,&#8221; even &#8220;60 Minutes.&#8221; Anchoring the CBS Evening News Sunday edition felt like a feather in my cap.<\/p>\n<p>Just shy of my 40th birthday, the road ended. I was called down to the office of the President of CBS News and was told, &#8220;They were moving in a different direction.&#8221; I was being fired. I. Was. Fired. They liked my work&hellip; but didn&#8217;t like it anymore&hellip; or just had other people coming in&#8230; Whatever it was, my days at CBS News had abruptly come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Being fired is an out-of-body experience. I remember it like it was yesterday. A mixture of anger, feeling victimized, feeling exhilarated and free, and feeling scared shitless all at once. But then the time starts to pass, and if you are like I was, the NEXT job couldn&#8217;t come soon enough.<\/p>\n<p>I sent my work to other networks and the response was&hellip; crickets. I went from everything to everyone to nothing to no one. If I did get an interview, the first question was: Why were you fired? I didn&#8217;t have an answer because I didn&#8217;t really know. Each job interview set me deeper back; deeper into knowing it was over. It&#8217;s hard to fight nothing. No phone ringing. No calls back. Just &#8220;No thank you,&#8221; from everywhere I applied. I would re-apply six months later. Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I did get an audition to anchor the local news at the ABC affiliate in Washington. I was told I was close&#8230; down to three. I went for the audition and was desperate for the job. So desperate it was written all over my face. They gave it to the talented Alison Starling who is still there to this day.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600691\"><\/div>\n<p>At about nine months of nothing, with severance running out, I knew I had to find another road. I began the task of applying for any job anywhere. I was overqualified for many jobs I applied for online, but still got no calls. Slowly&#8230; ever so slowly, I got responses from a few major PR firms. One, just one, called me in for an interview. I had the skills and the experience to do PR well.<\/p>\n<p>It was at this time that a good friend &mdash; a talented producer at CBS News &mdash; was in the process of getter fired too (or &#8220;released from her contract&#8221;). The turnover was continuing there and this time, it was my friend&#8217;s turn. Since I had been through it, I was coaching her through the process &mdash; the hurt, the anger, the loss, the fear. I was reliving it all with her. Knowing the place and the players, it really was like my loss all over again. She was one of the best producers there and had taught me everything I know about voice control, studio tracking and storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>My job interview turned into another one until it was down to a final round. A job as a VP at a major PR firm. Real money. It was the kind of money that would keep the family moving forward. We were at a dead stop with no hope in sight. This job was a potential lifeline&hellip; right there for the taking.<\/p>\n<p>I was waiting for the call to line up the last round. I&#8217;ll never forget the moment. Driving my pickup up the hill near my house, the &#8217;93 Ford 150 with roll-up windows just stopped&hellip; Stalled out and died. I knew that meant another $500 at the shop. $500 that I did not have. Then my cell phone rings. It&#8217;s the PR firm. Wanting to know if I can come in this week&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>I put the truck in park in the middle of the road and listened to myself as I said, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to come in but I have to be honest; I know someone better for the job. Perfect actually.&#8221; I then began to sing the praises of my soon-to-be fired friend. It came out of my mouth as if I had been practicing it forever&hellip; So easy to say, because it was true. She was perfect for the job, and I was not. I knew this road, as much as I needed one, would not be taken by me.<\/p>\n<p>I remember clunking my head on the steering wheel after I hung up asking myself: &#8220;Why, WHY?? You need a job so badly!&#8221; But I knew it even then. There was still only one road for me&hellip; and that this one wasn&#8217;t it. I knew even then I would have to find my way back to that road I chose at 13 years old. Somehow.<\/p>\n<p>It took many more months, but I called every network known to man and begged for ANY job they had available.

A Black American woman. I would be so jealous if I were anything else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I learned that &ldquo;Black&rdquo; was intended to mean &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; at the age of five and by the time I was ready for college I had only begun to learn why I should rejoice in my Blackness. I grew up in this spirit. I survived being &ldquo;the smart Black girl&rdquo; at majority white schools in this spirit, and rejected an opportunity for full scholarship at a predominately white institution to attend the best university on the globe (naturally a historically black one) &#8212; because of this spirit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Being a Black person at an HBCU is nothing short of divine. A community of academics who understand you, instructors who are exceptionally hard on you because they know what you&rsquo;re up against in this world, and an ever-present aura that dispels every negative thing that you were taught about your color from the moment you knew what it was.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I chopped off my chemically processed hair, took every class I could led by the master of Africana Studies, Dr. Gregory Carr, and wore an ankh on my body every chance I got.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Needless to say, I only dated Black men.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I find Black men physically attractive, what I really, really find attractive is the unspoken understanding that exists between me and a Black man of my choosing. I love not explaining why I tie my hair up at night, or that my skin would burn in beach sun without sunblock. I love arguing about whether &ldquo;Love Jones&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love and Basketball&rdquo; was the greatest Black love story of the &rsquo;90s. I could never date outside of Black men, I thought. It would never work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But I was W-R-O-N-G! I could and I did.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">We&rsquo;ll call him Mazzi for discretion&rsquo;s sake. He stood about 6 feet and 5 inches. He was handsome, funny, and a bit cynical. We worked in the same space, after I had graduated from college, for about a year. I hardly noticed him at the onset but eventually we began talking and sharing inside jokes and such. And one day he asked me on a date.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">There was naturally some apprehension: 1) because we worked together AND 2) because he was unquestionably a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I expressed my desire to keep it quiet at work and Mazzi agreed, so we went.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I laughed a lot that evening. Like from pick-up to drop-off. As our dates went on for some months, I began to notice the disapproving eyes of people around us when we were out together.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Do you see how people look at us?!&rdquo; I asked one day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said nonchalantly. &ldquo;It happens all the time. People don&rsquo;t have shit going on in their own lives so that fact that I&rsquo;m here with this &lsquo;self-aware&rsquo; Black woman is earth shattering to them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh. He smiled cautiously.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Time passed and we grew closer. I had just gotten into running and he was a thrower for his college&rsquo;s track team so he would offer me advice on what I can do to get faster and stronger (he also gave awesome back rubs). He was a writer who never put his thoughts down and I encouraged him to do so. He had become my sounding board when I would get overwhelmed and met disappointments in my medical school application process, and I was his &ldquo;therapist&rdquo; who eventually got to the root of his cynicism. We were comfortable with one another. At some point in all this, I changed jobs to work in my field and we no longer had the &ldquo;work thing&rdquo; to consider.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600604\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Here I was: Ms. HBCU, Afro-turned locs sporting, ankh wearing, and lover of all things Black &mdash; falling for a white man.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">He brought up the subject of a relationship and I retreated. I&rsquo;d talk about my reluctance to get in relationships (which was true) and he didn&rsquo;t push the issue. But of course eventually I entered a relationship with him because it only made sense.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My two closest friends were shocked but very supportive and liked him a lot. I liked him too. He was the ideal, except he wasn&rsquo;t Black.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">My family slowly began to pick up on the fact that this was more than a collection of dates and did not necessarily approve. This didn&rsquo;t impact me so much though. I was good at being rebellious.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">His family was really sweet to me and always invited and included me when going to dinners or family parties.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Though I never felt &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; throughout the course of our relationship, race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">I remember the first time it was brought to my attention. He was driving and talking to me on the phone with some friends in the car. His friends had been drinking one of them yelled into the phone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">&ldquo;Tell Ashley I miss her! Wait! Do Black people miss people?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Now you and I both know how idiotic of a statement that was, but my issue was not with his asshole of a friend, it was with his lack of response to the comment. He later told me he addressed it. I didn&rsquo;t believe him.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">When I would experience &ldquo;exotic otherness&rdquo; at work, I would talk to him about it and he would suggest that I was overreacting when I knew I wasn&rsquo;t. He would never know the feeling I was describing and I really couldn&rsquo;t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.xojane.com\/issues\/white-privilege-ferguson\"> expect him to understand<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Then once in an argument, he said that my beloved alma mater was &ldquo;institutionally racist.&rdquo; This was a HUGE mistake on his part. I don&rsquo;t remember my exact response but I am certain it was angry.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">These were tough issues we had to work through. And it was hard. In considering a future with him, I worried about these issues. And he got to a point where he would refuse to talk if he sensed that race would come up. I understood, it was tense between us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">But when it was good, which usually was the case, it was perfect. Then, during a period that I thought was a good one, he went through my phone while I was sleeping. He read messages between my friends and me about how I missed the comfort and familiarity of Black men&#8230; OUCH!<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">Race was an issue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">To know me is to know that a violation of my privacy is grounds for dismissal. I felt guilty, so I didn&rsquo;t break up with him right way. But from that point forward, I stopped feeling like myself. I was no longer mentally present in the relationship and I strongly resented the phone incident. The race thing was too hard and I had stopped &ldquo;trying&rdquo; because I knew he didn&rsquo;t trust me anyway. I ended it a few months later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ng-scope\">This was in August. And I would be fooling myself if I said I don&rsquo;t sometimes think I made a mistake.

In the U.S., it was &#8220;the worst time to be queer because you are not being ignored, you are actively searched for and persecuted,&#8221; said John D&#8217;Emilio, a professor of gay and lesbian studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &#8220;The nice thing about the movie is that it is calling attention to this bit of history that people don&rsquo;t know anything about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596955\/the-price-of-genius\/\" target=\"_blank\">The price of genius<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In Britain&mdash;where America&#8217;s own sodomy laws originated&mdash;the story begins in 1533, during the reign of Henry the VIII. That year, the Buggery Act made male sex a capital offense in Britain, punishable by death, usually by hanging. That remained the law until 1861, when the sentence was changed from death to prison, usually with hard labor. In 1885, the law was broadened to criminalize &#8220;gross indecency&#8221; a vague, catch-all term used to prosecute anything considered to be deviant sexual behavior outside of sodomy, mostly between men. In 1895, the playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years of prison and hard labor, about which he penned a poem called &#8220;The Balad of Reading Gaol.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During Alan Turing&#8217;s life, public concern over the possibility that homosexuals serving in the military or aiding in the war effort could be blackmailed by enemies intensified the stigma of homosexuality in Britain. After Turing was convicted in 1952, the British government took away his security clearance. Turing was exposed after he reported a petty theft to the police, involving his lover. Their relationship was discovered by the police through his reporting of the crime. He pleaded guilty and opted for hormone treatments, known as chemical castration, instead of prison time. He tragically killed himself with cyanide in 1954.<\/p>\n<p>The 1950s, was the beginning of the end for Britain&#8217;s laws against homosexual sex, as the prosecution of prominent people stoked a public backlash against the laws. In 1954, a well known journalist, Peter Wildeblood was convicted of homosexual acts with two prominent and wealthy men, Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, in a public trial that resulted in prison time for all of the men and public opposition to laws against homosexual sex. The trial lead to the creation of the Wolfenden committee of government representatives, ministers, educators, and psychiatrists, which in 1957, published a report recommending the discontinuation of laws against homosexuality.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599607\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3594876\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>The report eventually led to the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, which ended the criminalization of homosexual sex between consenting men over the age of 21 in Britain and Wales. In 1994, the age was lowered to 18, and in 2003, it was lowered to 16, the same age for consenting heterosexual sex.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. history is slightly different from Britain&#8217;s. The fervent prosecution of gay sex didn&#8217;t start to happen in earnest until the very period during which Turing lived. The U.S. had anti-sodomy laws inherited from the English settlers, but it wasn&#8217;t until the late 1930s, 40s and 50s, during a period coinciding with the World Wars and a strong strain of Christian morality, that police in the U.S. made it a priority to enforce laws against homosexuals.<\/p>\n<p>As in England, concerns that homosexuals could be blackmailed by Communist spies&mdash;an idea popularized by Senator Joe McCarthy&mdash;drove some of the fervor against homosexuals during that period. In the U.S.&mdash;more so than in Britain, it seems&mdash;the period was marked by increased police enforcement of the laws. Police officers went undercover in public parks where homosexuals went to meet each other for sexual encounters, in order to uncover them. It was a period of fear for homosexuals in America unparalleled before or since. &#8220;This is the height of what I call the homosexual terror in America,&#8221; said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of<em> Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596961\/review-the-imitation-game\/\" target=\"_blank\">TIME reviews <em>The Imitation Game<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>During this same period, Eskridge said, states began to pass laws that allowed courts to institutionalize gay people indefinitely in mental institutions for having &#8220;psychotic personalities,&#8221; where were experimented on, lobotomized, and given shock therapy.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case with Turing, the prosecution of gays also denied the U.S. some very bright minds who, but for their homosexuality, might have been allowed to contribute more to society. In the late 1950&#8242;s, Frank Kameny, an astronomer with a Ph.D. from Harvard, was kicked out of the Army Map Service and barred from serving in theUS government because he was a homosexual.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of geniuses of 20th century, the father of modern computers who helped win World War II, who was a lovely person, was destroyed by the anti homosexual terror,&#8221; Eskridge said of Turing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3558879\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%20%7C%20TIME&body=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%0A%0AAlan%20Turing%20wasn%27t%20the%20only%20one%20who%20suffered%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6qb&text=The%20history%20behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%27s%20The%20Imitation%20Game&via=TIMEHistory\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F&title=The+History+Behind+Benedict+Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s+The+Imitation+Game\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3599607\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599607\/imitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing\/\" data-title=\"The History Behind Benedict Cumberbatch&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;\/i&gt;\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"History","slug":"history","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/history\/","description":"The news in context, from the archives of TIME.

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.<\/p>\n<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?<\/p>\n<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2014\/11\/19\/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">decided there was not sufficient evidence<\/a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/articles\/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde\/\">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde<\/a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599631\"><\/div>\n<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know<\/em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.<\/p>\n<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.<\/p>\n<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission.

His office pointed to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/remarks-president-comprehensive-immigration-reform\">2010 Obama statement<\/a> in which the President said that providing undocumented workers legal status &ldquo;could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The action by the President yesterday will only encourage more people to come here illegally and put their lives at risk,&rdquo; said Boehner. &ldquo;We saw the humanitarian crisis on our border last summer&mdash;how horrific it was. Well next summer, it could be worse.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Boehner was referring to a surge in unaccompanied minors from October 2013 through September, when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/newsroom\/stats\/southwest-border-unaccompanied-children-2014\">over 68,000<\/a> unaccompanied minors crossed the southwest border, a 77% increase over the previous year. (The number of children coming over has sharply declined in the past few months.)<\/p>\n<p>But Doris Meissner, the director of the Migration Policy Institute&#8217;s immigration policy work, said that Boehner&#8217;s criticism was off. Here&#8217;s what she told TIME:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It goes to the more general idea of whether a legal status program functions as a magnet to future illegal immigration and that&rsquo;s always something that&rsquo;s been out there and has been a concern, but the reality today is that we have invested so much in southwest border enforcement&hellip;and the President has underscored that again that he is going to allocate even more additional resources to border enforcement. The evidence that we have is that our illegal immigration across the southwest border is at it&rsquo;s lowest level since the early 1970s when the current wave of illegal immigration largely from Mexico began, we have net minus immigration from Mexico.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3600239\"><\/div>\n<p>The child migrant spurt that happened over the last year was much more a function of conditions in those three countries&mdash;Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador&mdash;and notion of &#8216;permisos&#8217; in the United States. But that&rsquo;s now really receded dramatically. So if you take the spurt of Central American crossings out of the numbers for last year, you find the lowest levels of illegal immigration apprehensions across the southwest border in decades. Now that&rsquo;s not to say that you can discount Central American migration but&#8230;it&rsquo;s a function of different circumstances then the illegal immigration that has led to what the President is saying now.<\/p>\n<p>This action that he has taken now is retrospective. You have to have been in the country for five years to qualify for it. It&rsquo;s for people as of the date of announcement; there&rsquo;s no eligibility for people that might be coming forward in the future. I do think that the underpinnings today are quite different and it&rsquo;s pretty hard to make the case that this particular action would spur a future migration.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3600239\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Obama%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Increase%20Illegal%20Immigration%2C%20Expert%20Says%20%7C%20TIME&body=Obama%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Won%E2%80%99t%20Increase%20Illegal%20Immigration%2C%20Expert%20Says%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6An&text=Obama%27s%20actions%20won%27t%20increase%20illegal%20immigration%2C%20expert%20says.&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3600239%2Fobama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert%2F&title=Obama%E2%80%99s+Actions+Won%E2%80%99t+Increase+Illegal+Immigration%2C+Expert+Says\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3600239\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3600239\/obama-illegal-immigration-boehner-expert\/\" data-title=\"Obama&amp;#8217;s Actions Won&amp;#8217;t Increase Illegal Immigration, Expert Says\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>osby Show<\/i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?<\/p>\n<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.<\/p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>harm anyone, even indirectly?<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599978\/cosby-show-reruns-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599394\"><\/div>\n<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son<\/em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596545\/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">silence<\/a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599394\"><\/div><\/aside><aside

series. As part of our ongoing search for leaders of tomorrow who are working hard to change their worlds today we're introducing seven more young people from around the world who have not just succeeded in their fields but have also persuaded others to share their vision. We launched this new program in September after spending several months carefully looking at young people whose achievements in fields such as business, science, activism and sport are matched by their ability to bring others with them as they turn their dreams into reality. These young leaders have already made an impact in their fields but in many respects they are just getting started so we intend to keep writing about them on TIME.com as they develop and thrive. Meanwhile, we have already started looking for the third class of these young leaders and will introduce them to you in the first half of 2015. <\/p><\/div>\n      <\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n\n  <div class=\"right\">\n    <div class=\"touts\">\n        <div class=\"tout clearfix\">\n          <a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583173\/ann-osman-mma-muslim-fighter\/\" class=\"tout-thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB\/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" data-src=\"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/ann-osman-mma-mixed-martial-arts-01.jpg?crop=1153px%2C655px%2C352px%2C353px&amp;resize=100%2C100\" alt=\"Mixed Martial Artist Ann Osman poses for a portrait before competing in the One Fighting Championship event on Oct. 16, 2014 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\" \/>\n          <\/a>\n          <h4><a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583173\/ann-osman-mma-muslim-fighter\/\">Woman Warrior: Female MMA Fighter Leads by Example<\/a><\/h4>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"tout clearfix\">\n          <a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583179\/hiv-aids-south-africa\/\" class=\"tout-thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB\/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" data-src=\"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/phindile-sithole-spong-hiv-visionary-activist.jpg?crop=1323px%2C168px%2C647px%2C647px&amp;resize=100%2C100\" alt=\"Phindile Sithole-Spong, HIV visionary, writer, and activist, at her home in Johannesburg, South Africa.\" \/>\n          <\/a>\n          <h4><a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583179\/hiv-aids-south-africa\/\">Facing Up to HIV<\/a><\/h4>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"tout clearfix\">\n          <a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583191\/social-network-scientists-builder\/\" class=\"tout-thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB\/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" data-src=\"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/researchgate-founder-ijad-madisch.jpg?crop=1095px%2C560px%2C355px%2C355px&amp;resize=100%2C100\" alt=\"ResearchGate founder Ijad Madisch at his office on Oct. 28, 2014 in Berlin.\" \/>\n          <\/a>\n          <h4><a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583191\/social-network-scientists-builder\/\">The Architect of a Social Network for Scientists<\/a><\/h4>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"tout clearfix\">\n          <a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583188\/superbugs-saudi-virologist\/\" class=\"tout-thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB\/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" data-src=\"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/saudi-microbiologist-hosam-zowawi.jpg?crop=1065px%2C98px%2C505px%2C505px&amp;resize=100%2C100\" alt=\"Hosam Mamoon Zowawi  in his laboratory at the UQCCR Centre for Clinical Research.\" \/>\n          <\/a>\n          <h4><a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583188\/superbugs-saudi-virologist\/\">How to Stop Superbugs<\/a><\/h4>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"tout clearfix\">\n          <a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583520\/shareable-feast\/\" class=\"tout-thumbnail\">\n            <img src=\"data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB\/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" data-src=\"http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/iseult-ward-foodcloud-ceo.jpg?crop=820px%2C198px%2C890px%2C890px&amp;resize=100%2C100\" alt=\"Iseult Ward, Founder and CEO of Irish company Foodcloud, which links businesses with surplus to charities in need, via an app.\" \/>\n          <\/a>\n          <h4><a  href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583520\/shareable-feast\/\">Want to Solve Hunger AND Food Waste?

The cameraman no longer has to use plastic water bottles as counterweights. The news desk doesn&rsquo;t look like it was borrowed from a school.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is only the second time we&rsquo;ve filmed here,&rdquo; says host Winyu Wongsurawat, from behind his trademark wraparound sunglasses. &ldquo;Before we just used to shoot in a whitewashed corner of a room.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Winyu founded <em>Shallow News in Depth <\/em>as a pet project with his sister Janya in 2008. The show&rsquo;s audience has grown steadily. Each episode now attracts about 250,000 views on YouTube and generates enough advertising revenue to help fund a full-time team of 40 and, since October, the new studio. The show, with its zany animations and pre-recorded jingles, provides a madcap voice of reason amid Thailand&rsquo;s fractious political scene. &ldquo;We want young people to understand the news,&rdquo; says the 29-year-old Winyu, who before stardom flipped from studying performing arts to political science. &ldquo;So we thought to have a show that is easy and fun.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>It is also courageous. Following six months of deadly pro- and anti-government demonstrations, Thailand&rsquo;s military staged a coup on May 22. The junta has since detained more than 200 journalists, academics and activists. Nevertheless, <em>Shallow News in Depth<\/em> refuses to pull its punches, recently mocking specific government officials who have accrued enormous personal wealth despite their modest wages. So far, Winyu has somehow escaped the generals&rsquo; ire. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t know if the military get our jokes,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The Bangkok <em>Post<\/em> dubbed Winyu&rsquo;s frenetic style &ldquo;Jon Stewart on crack,&rdquo; after the host of American satirical news program <em>The Daily Show<\/em>. &ldquo;Winyu&rsquo;s not shouting at the screen, as Stewart often does, and his criticism of individuals is less direct,&ldquo; says Dan Waites, author of <em>CultureShock! Bangkok<\/em>, a book on Thai etiquette and sensibilities. &ldquo;But if you understand the context, and read between the lines, it&rsquo;s hilarious and damning stuff.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/john-winyu-wongsurawat-shallow-news-in-depth.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"John Winyu Wongsurawat\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Cedric Arnold for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Although Winyu draws inspiration from Stewart and other late-night American hosts including Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon, the spur to merge politics and humor first came from his academic parents. While Winyu&rsquo;s mother, an Illinois-born arts teacher, would become incensed during the family&rsquo;s weekend political discussions, their father, a Thai political science professor, would preach calm. &ldquo;So we tried to do the same and not get angry but treat it as a joke,&rdquo; says Winyu.<\/p>\n<p>He also learned to challenge the status quo from outspoken Thai social commentators like the eminent pacifist professor of political science Chaiwat Satha-Anand. Chaiwat, in turn, praises how Winyu uniquely &ldquo;infuses a wonderful sense of humor &mdash; some very deadpan, some rather dark &mdash; to stimulate Thai political discourse in this difficult time.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Winyu and his staff explain sensitive political topics &mdash; like the billions of dollars squandered in an ill-conceived rice-pricing scheme &mdash; through tart infographics that spell out what they see as the flaws in government and opposition policies. By going after all of Thailand&rsquo;s political factions equally, Winyu demonstrates that blind dogma is his real quarry. &ldquo;We are like a piece of candy which is covered in sugar, but inside are the vitamins,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Winyu has inspired scores of other young Thais to take to YouTube with their own homespun satirical news shows, a hopeful indication of political engagement in a nation where critical evaluation is largely missing from mainstream education. &ldquo;<em>Shallow News<\/em> is a massive influence,&rdquo; says Jukapong Elmsaard, 26, a Thai pop-culture blogger and aspiring novelist. &ldquo;I learned that by making my work funny, people find knowledge easier to absorb.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While the junta remains in power and political dysfunction continues, Winyu and the young satirists he has emboldened are unlikely to run out of critiques to share with their audiences. Or, for that matter, jokes.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\"

in Depth<\/em><\/strong><strong>?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At home, on Saturday and Sunday we would always talk about politics and my mom was always very serious and stressed about what was happening. But my dad would always say, &ldquo;Look calm down, you can&rsquo;t be too serious about what&rsquo;s going on in Thailand or you&rsquo;ll go crazy &mdash; look at it as a joke.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It was the same thing with me and [my sister] Janya; we tried to take the situation but make it more fun and less serious &mdash; look at it as if it&rsquo;s a joke. About six years ago we talked about having a show online to help the younger generation understand [Thai politics] easier.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>Who in the industry do you admire or wish to emulate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The inspiration for me is Comedy Central and people like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, but even the late-night shows such as Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon, where they have a monologue to talk about the current situation but with comedy and jokes.<\/p>\n<p>I want to do that in Thailand. In Thailand, when you talk about the news it&#8217;s very serious and the younger generation want to stay away. And so that&rsquo;s why we took inspiration from Jon Stewart and wanted to make it fun.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your father is Thai and your mother is American. Does that affect the way viewers treat you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah maybe, because of our appearance, but only really for the first few episodes. A lot of Thai people at first were commenting on YouTube, &ldquo;How dare you talk about Thailand when you look so <em>farang<\/em> [foreign].&rdquo; But that was only for two or three episodes and right now we are on 137 episodes.<\/p>\n<p>All my family, except my mom who&rsquo;s American, went through the Thai national education system, we live in Thailand, we eat Thai food &mdash; we are so Thai!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Certainly, your style is very Thai &mdash; was that always your intention?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our style is more for Thai people because we are trying to relate to the Thai audience. A lot of stuff we talk about is the Thai way of life so we have to make fun with Thai jokes. But in the last three or four shows we&rsquo;ve [included] the English subtitles to try to help foreigners get the Thai jokes also.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Was it a struggle to make your show a success?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For the first two or three years we didn&rsquo;t make any money, as online TV was very new to Thailand. So trying to convince the advertising agency to understand was very hard, because they kept asking us what time or what day or week will the show be on. But people are starting to get to know <em>Shallow News in Depth<\/em> and we are starting to make money from ads.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the next step to move to mainstream television?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It would be great to move onto mainstream TV but it&#8217;s very hard to send out these types of messages as a lot of the channels are still hooked to officials, so it would be hard for us to make the same jokes.<\/p>\n<p>Editorial independence is very important. So we&rsquo;re more comfortable online and have more freedom. We&rsquo;re still a little bit afraid of what may happen in the future, looking at what&rsquo;s going on with martial law and censorship in Thailand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You famously did a dance to thanks General Prayuth Chan-ocha for not staging a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat &mdash; and then he did. Were you nervous?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We filmed that a few months before the coup. We were hoping that he wouldn&rsquo;t do anything and then suddenly he came out with martial law and the next day it happened. We were disappointed, as it&rsquo;s almost 20 times now for Thailand and we were hoping that things had finally changed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Has the military been in contact about your show?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. We were a little bit concerned after the coup, as a lot of journalists had been called in to stay with the military for a week or month to change their point of view. But we decided that we&rsquo;re online and just to keep doing the show. We want to cover the seriousness with comedy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>To what extent is your show a reaction to the way the Thai education system fails to foster critical evaluation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We went through [the] Thai education system and our parents are still teaching in Thai universities so we understand what young people go through. So we want our show to make people start to think more and question more the situation in Thailand. Even just to compare what happened now and what happened in the past, and look forward &mdash; what do you want your society to be like? That&rsquo;s the main reason for the show.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interview by Charlie Campbell.

Osman looks un-impressed as she glances at photographs of her prefight weigh-in on social-media sites. This isn&rsquo;t because her opponent, Aya Saeid Saber, tried to provoke her before their mixed-martial-arts (MMA) fight, which will take place the following day, but because Osman&rsquo;s smartphone is showing her just how many people have already made sexually loaded comments about photos of the weigh-in.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t happen to guys,&rdquo; says Osman, 28, between bites of sushi on the eve of her Oct. 17 bout in Kuala Lumpur. &ldquo;But then again, I just ignore them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As the first female Muslim MMA fighter to compete at the top level of the rapidly growing, albeit sometimes very violent sport, Osman has already had to knock down as many stereotypes as opponents since her professional debut late last year. Along the way she has been very publicly showing that Muslim women in Malaysia do not have to be docile in a country where conservative, religious norms often force women into traditional roles and where religious figures hold increasing sway over society.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>Osman says there is nothing un-Islamic about her fighting career. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe religion should stop us. Islam teaches us to work hard,&rdquo; says Osman, who is signed with Asia&rsquo;s dominant MMA promoter, ONE Fighting Championship (ONE FC). &ldquo;I may not be the perfect Muslim woman, but I hope to inspire others.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Male fighters have largely dominated the sport since the first major MMA event was held in Denver, Colorado, in 1993. However, an influx of female fighters in recent years, notably in Japan and the U.S., has carved out an increasingly prominent place for women in the sport.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the biggest stars in the sport in the U.S. are now women and in Japan, an all-female promotion was formed over a decade ago. But elsewhere, women&rsquo;s MMA is only just beginning to emerge from its early stage of development. Osman participated in ONE FC&rsquo;s second female bout in late 2013, when only a handful of women had signed with the company. Twelve months later, there are 15 women on contract.<\/p>\n<p>Osman&rsquo;s willingness to confront challengers in the wire cage where the fights take place is inspiring more women to slip on MMA gloves. In the process of learning to defend themselves in training, many of those women are gaining confidence outside the gym. &ldquo;I had one supporter who said she was in an abusive relationship and seeing me being strong and learning martial arts kind of inspired her to learn self-defense,&rdquo; says Osman, adding that the fan is now out of the relationship and still training hard.<\/p>\n<p>Lim Yeow Chet, who runs an MMA gym in Malaysia&rsquo;s capital, says he had no female clients one year ago. Now he coaches more than 30 women, including some Muslims&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all because of Osman. &ldquo;They say, &lsquo;I want to be like her,&rsquo;&rdquo; Lim explains. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s actually opening up the horizon for women in Malaysia and Asia.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/malaysian-mixed-martial-artist-ann-osman.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Malaysian Mixed Martial Artist Ann Osman\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Adam Ferguson for Time<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Osman&rsquo;s rise to prominence in the sport hasn&rsquo;t come easily, though; her record since she turned professional is two wins and one loss. During her first contest she rallied from behind after taking nearly 30 knees to the mid-section in the opening round. She lost the fight on a split decision, but her dogged resolve made her a fan favorite. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s proud. She&rsquo;s confident. She portrays what women should be like&mdash;someone who can protect themselves,&rdquo; says fan Nadia Nasir, 26, who watched Osman&rsquo;s bruising first-round victory over Saber, an Egyptian Muslim, last month at the Stadium Putra, along with 10,000 other fight fans.<\/p>\n<p>Before dispensing with Saber, Osman says she prepared mentally for the win weeks in advance. During her commute to and from the gym and before going to sleep, Osman would listen to her walkout song, while visualizing the pace of the bout in her head. The key to winning, she explains, begins with believing in yourself. &ldquo;[It&rsquo;s about] having that right mentality and saying this cage is mine and I&rsquo;m going to bring home the win,&rdquo; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Osman says she first learned to square up to tough challenges from her mother. In the late 1980s, the matriarch of the Osman clan took her three toddler-aged daughters in tow to the U.S., where she studied at Southern Illinois University. Life wasn&rsquo;t easy, as her mother balanced a rigorous academic schedule with raising a family far from home, where her husband had stayed to work. &ldquo;I told them in order to be successful you have to really work at it,&rdquo; says Osman&rsquo;s mother Florence Anthony Tom. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it from the sky.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The message appears to have stuck. Now, Osman&#8217;s ultimate goal is to become the undisputed titleholder in her weight class. ONE FC officials say there aren&rsquo;t yet enough women fighters to merit a championship belt. But thanks to Osman, it seems only a matter of time before she&mdash;and the women she has steered into the cage&mdash;will have a shot at MMA glory.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\"

pm","short":"11\/13","hide_date":false},"content":"<p><strong>Some people are critical of a Muslim woman fighting in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), especially in Islamic countries. What do you say to your critics?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Being a mixed martial artist and being a Muslim as well shouldn&rsquo;t hinder what I want to do or with achieving my goals or my ambition. I work hard at what I do and I always believe in myself and to me that&rsquo;s what matters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>During this last year your popularity has soared and now more women in Malaysia are getting into MMA. How does that make you feel?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Actually that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping for. When I started fighting as an amateur, MMA in Malaysia had just started growing. There weren&rsquo;t many MMA gyms. There weren&rsquo;t many people training. Now, there&rsquo;s a surplus of women joining MMA gyms and training. It&rsquo;s good.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>Do you feel any pressure to be a role model?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t see myself as a role model yet. That&rsquo;s a big thing. I just hope to inspire other women or even boys [and] girls and men out there to do what they want to do. Whatever you set your mind [to] you can achieve as long as you put in the commitment and work hard. That&rsquo;s all that matters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Many of your fans say they look up to you because you&rsquo;re confident, fit and can protect yourself. Do you hope to promote self-defense through MMA?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My supporters have told me that I inspire them to defend themselves. Seeing me getting bashed up in the cage and defending myself kind of inspires them in some ways. I had one supporter who said she was in an abusive relationship and seeing me being strong and learning martial arts kind of inspired her to learn self-defense and she actually got out of that abusive relationship. Now, she&rsquo;s training in one of the best gyms in [Kuala Lumpur]. That&rsquo;s great. I love hearing stories like that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe there&rsquo;s still discrimination against women in MMA?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To be honest, yes, there&rsquo;s still some discrimination. Still, at this point even after three fights and being with ONE FC for one year, people still don&rsquo;t really take women&rsquo;s MMA that seriously. Some people even comment saying things like: &lsquo;I should just stay in the kitchen.&rsquo; But, I tend to just ignore these people because I never let them get into my head and start influencing me. Like they say, haters gonna hate &mdash; you can&rsquo;t just except everyone to love you.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to prove a point that women can fight. This is not just a male sport.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Before your most recent fight, guys started leaving sexually loaded comments on social media following your heated weigh-in with Aya Saeid Saber after she got in your face. Do you feel like there&rsquo;s always going to be reactions like that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Isn&rsquo;t the first word that&rsquo;s supposed to come to mind &#8216;fierce&#8217;? Instead they&rsquo;re like &lsquo;oh, they&rsquo;re gonna kiss!&rsquo; That doesn&rsquo;t happen to guys, but it happens to girls. But then again, I just ignore them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you still get nervous before a fight?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe before my first fight, I had some nerves. As long as I know I&rsquo;ve been training hard, I&rsquo;m confident going in. It&rsquo;s comes with preparation as well. I&rsquo;m more excited about going into the cage and doing my job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the most insightful lesson you&rsquo;ve learned during your fighting career?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The best lesson I&rsquo;ve learned is to have the right mindset before going to [train] or [going] to fight. For instance, if you go to [train] and all you think about is [how] you&rsquo;re tired then your body starts breaking down and you won&rsquo;t be able to train well.<\/p>\n<p>The same goes when you go into a fight. If you think that you&rsquo;re going to lose or [if] you believe in what those negative people are saying is true then you&rsquo;ll probably perform [badly]. But if you do the opposite and think [positively] and say this training means a lot to me [and for] a few more weeks I&rsquo;m going to do this, I&rsquo;m going to give everything to this training, then you&rsquo;re going to perform well.<\/p>\n<p>Before fight week, I listen to my walk out song for days &mdash; before I sleep, on the way to the gym, back from the gym. I just keep visualizing how it&rsquo;s going to [go], what to do and what to expect. [It&rsquo;s about] having that right mentality and saying this cage is mine and I&rsquo;m going to bring home the win.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your walk out song and why did you choose it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s this song by Fabolous featuring Jeremih called: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s My Time.&rdquo; The reason why I chose it &mdash; I think I was the [first] fighter to submit my song &mdash; [is] because it&rsquo;s my time to be here in Malaysia. And it&rsquo;s my turn to win and represent Malaysia.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interview by Adam Ferguson and David Stout.

Sithole-Spong, 25, smiles and begins telling her audience how she met her beau. &ldquo;How did you tell him you have HIV?&rdquo; asks a lanky young man. The chattering boys and girls quiet with anticipation. So taboo is HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, that even though many of them have friends or family members who are HIV-positive, few of the teens dare to speak about it. To them, hearing Sithole-Spong&rsquo;s stories about living openly with HIV, in a country where the virus is deeply stigmatized despite the fact that nearly 20% of the population carries the virus, is a revelation.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>Sithole-Spong&rsquo;s life is, deliberately, an open book. She meticulously chronicles her friendships, romances and medical routines on social media as part of her campaign to erase taboos around HIV\/AIDS. As the founder and CEO of Rebranding HIV, a consultancy that helps companies such as Shell South Africa and South Africa&rsquo;s power utility ESKOM tailor HIV-education outreach for their employees, she believes she has to be transparent about her own life. That is the only way, she says, to de-stigmatize a disease that infects more than 460,000 every year in the country. HIV used to be a death sentence, says Sithole-Spong. &ldquo;Today it isn&rsquo;t. When you contract HIV you can still be a girlfriend, you can still party with your friends, you can be whatever you want to be.&rdquo; Her openness, she says, is &ldquo;my public declaration that, &lsquo;Look, I am HIV-positive, but I also have a very normal life.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Sithole-Spong only discovered that she had been born HIV-positive at the age of 19, when she developed symptoms of advanced AIDS. She has since recovered, but bitter experiences of coming out as an HIV-positive college student, combined with a dearth of information on how to live a healthy life with the virus, inspired her to work towards developing what she calls an &ldquo;HIV-aware generation.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the best advocates are the ones who are brave, strong and empowered to speak from their own experiences,&rdquo; says Alan Smith, a senior advisor on HIV at International Planned Parenthood Federation, a non-governmental organization that promotes sexual health.&ldquo;Her work to lead organizations to adapt and improve their efforts on HIV interventions is a great step.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/phindili-sithole-hiv-activist.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Phindile Sithole-Spong, HIV visionary, writer, and activist, at her home in Johannesburg, South Africa\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Jonathan Torgovnik&mdash;Reportage by Getty Images for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Sithole-Spong&rsquo;s work, she says, is a rebuttal to the global slogan for addressing the spread of the disease that asks people to &ldquo;Imagine a HIV-free generation.&rdquo; It misses the point, she says. South Africa won&rsquo;t be HIV-free until people who carry the virus can talk freely about their status. &ldquo;That is how we will reduce new HIV infections because then the HIV-positive people will not feel a need to hide it. They will use protection, they will be more aware of themselves, and they will be more confident.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Sithole-Spong has become a sought-after public speaker. She has given speeches at the African Union and at last year&rsquo;s UNAIDS conference, where she emphasized the need for treatment that transcends drugs and anti-retrovirals to address the psychological impact of living with the disease. On Oct. 30, she spoke at New York City&rsquo;s Black Ball gala event, in honor of singer Alicia Keys&rsquo; Keep a Child Alive charity, which supports children with HIV in Africa. (At the event, rapper Kanye West called her &ldquo;amazing.&rdquo;)<\/p>\n<p>Back in South Africa her influence grows every time she hands out her phone number and email address, as she does to the adolescents gathered in the garden of the halfway house. Already she has some 600 HIV-positive youths reaching out to her by phone and on Facebook for advice and encouragement. That number will almost certainly continue to rise, and for Sithole-Spong, one more HIV-positive teen reaching out to her is one less young South African facing the isolation and stigmatization she suffered.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\"

How did that happen?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In retrospect, we should have known. I was always sick and I even had shingles at 16, which is very unusual. But my [adoptive] mother was into natural healing, so we never went to a doctor. At the time it was probably one of the hardest experiences in my life. But it also made me the strong, outgoing and independent person that I am today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What was it like telling people you had HIV?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I came out about my status it was difficult in that a lot of people still had misconceptions about HIV and so they imposed those onto me and who I am, as opposed to looking at me as a human being who just so happens to have a virus. But it&rsquo;s also been the best thing I have done for myself in my life. Because now I feel like I really am an open book, I have nothing to hide and it&rsquo;s just given me so much freedom.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>So how did you get from that point to where you are now, running your own consultancy, mentoring hundreds of HIV-positive youth, and speaking about HIV awareness around the world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Probably a lot of introspection, a lot of counseling, a lot of crying (laughs). But also a lot of laughing and learning. I am learning from other people, and realizing that [discovering I was HIV-positive] didn&rsquo;t have to be my most defining moment. Of course right now in where I am and what I do, it does define me, but it is not all that defines me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do we need to &ldquo;rebrand&rdquo; HIV?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think its time we took ownership of HIV and what it means to be HIV-positive in the South African context as opposed to in the European or global context. It is great that we have the best ARV [Anti-retroviral] treatment rates in the world, and that has saved the lives of thousands of people who would have otherwise certainly died of AIDS. But we have not really dealt with what it means to be HIV-positive in this country.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There is a perception that having HIV is a death sentence. Why does that need to change?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because we cling to concepts of what HIV was, we are not really ready to embrace the new realities to redefine HIV and rebrand it so to speak. HIV isn&rsquo;t a black disease; it&rsquo;s not a gay disease. It&rsquo;s a virus; it affects everyone. And we need to make that heard. I feel we don&rsquo;t do that effectively. But I think we are on the way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You disagree with South Africa&rsquo;s adoption of the global slogan, &ldquo;Imagine an HIV-free generation.&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sure it&rsquo;s something we can strive towards, but it&rsquo;s not going to happen. No one has paid attention to the fact that in the 80s and 90s hundreds of thousands of children were born to HIV-positive parents, and now they are at the point where they are transitioning into adulthood, and want relationships and families of their own. Until we deal with that generation, we cannot achieve an HIV-free generation. Rather than say &#8220;prevent, prevent, prevent&#8221; how about we &#8220;treat, treat, treat&#8221;? And make sure we are taking care of everyone&rsquo;s needs emotionally and physically. That is how we will reduce new HIV infections because then the HIV-positive people will not feel a need to hide it. They will use protection, they will be more aware of themselves. So yeah, an HIV-aware generation is much better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So psychotherapy and counseling should be part of standard HIV treatment?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The assumption was that HIV was simply a physical manifestation, that it&rsquo;s just something that happens to the body. But it is also something that very much happens to the mind. One of those things is sexuality. Rather than saying [to HIV-positive people], &#8220;Just take a pill,&#8221; we need to address those issues. Everyone has sex, but now we need to teach &#8220;yes, you are HIV-positive, yes, this might change the fact that now you are not going to have unprotected sex but that doesn&rsquo;t make you any less a man or a woman just because you are using protection.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>You are very open and frank with intimate details of your life, from romance to doctor visits.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What I am trying to portray is that you can have it all. When you contract HIV you can still be a girlfriend, you can still be a friend, you can still go party with your friends, you can still be a cook, you can still be whatever you want to be. How I make my choices right now is my form of activism. It&rsquo;s my public declaration that, &#8220;Look, I am HIV-positive, but I also have a very normal life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you ever wish you didn&rsquo;t have HIV?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Certainly there were times, but over the past year I have realized that it has made me a better person. I wouldn&rsquo;t be the person that I am today, and I actually like the person that I am today.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interview by Aryn Baker.

this year, as the worst-ever outbreak of Ebola unfolded in West Africa, Ijad Madisch was tracking the virus from his Berlin office as it spread across the globe. But the 33-year-old wasn&rsquo;t looking at the data on infection rates or experimental drugs, though his doctorate in virology would make him perfectly qualified to do so. He was watching the scientists who use his social network, ResearchGate, come alive with discussions and ideas on how to fight Ebola even faster than the virus itself was spreading.<\/p>\n<p>It was the kind of crisis Madisch built his start-up to help address. Founded in 2008, ResearchGate has grown to become one of the biggest platforms for scientists to share their research online, and, as Madisch puts it, &ldquo;break out of the four walls&rdquo; of their labs and universities. With backing from investors like Bill Gates and Peter Thiel, ResearchGate has secured funding worth more than $35 million and now boasts some 5 million scientists from around the world as users. Its goal is to get them to collaborate faster across disparate fields of research &mdash; even fast enough to help contain an outbreak.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>&ldquo;This is the only way to solve such problems,&rdquo; says Madisch. &ldquo;You get knowledge from different disciplines, not only from the virologists working on Ebola.&#8221; Chemists and computer scientists could also offer input. And the research needed to deal with the crisis may have already been carried out years ago &mdash; but until ResearchGate came along, there was no easy way to access it. &ldquo;We just wouldn&rsquo;t know about it, because the way we discover knowledge is so broken,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The reigning model of scientific discovery has been slow to adapt to the Internet Age. Scientists usually toil in their labs for years, keeping their work secret to avoid copycats, before sending their final results to an established journal like <em>Nature<\/em> or <em>Science<\/em>. There, the peer-review process can take months before the work sees print &mdash; if it ever does. All the experiments that failed along the road to those results are usually thrown out, leaving other scientists to repeat the same mistakes without knowing it.<\/p>\n<p>ResearchGate, along with other websites in the so-called &ldquo;open science&rdquo; movement, encourage researchers to publish their failed experiments online so that others know to avoid them. &ldquo;We need to let scientists think of negative results as positive results. We should not differentiate anymore,&rdquo; says Madisch. That insight is what inspired Madisch to quit his career in medicine in 2007 and devote all his time to building the social network.<\/p>\n<p>A mentor at the medical school in Hanover where he went to practice after Harvard thought the idea would flop. &ldquo;He told me that scientists are not social,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;That this will never change.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/researchgate-founder-ijad-madisch1.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"ResearchGate founder Ijad Madisch\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Mustafah Abdulaziz for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But the changes have since gone viral. The journal <em>Science<\/em>, a bastion of the scientific establishment first published in 1880, decided this year to make all of its Ebola-related content available to all readers for free, following the open-access model that Madisch has been preaching for years.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly unusual,&rdquo; says Martin Enserink, the <em>Science<\/em> editor overseeing the initiative. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the journal will move away from its core model of peer-reviewed and pay-walled publications from scientists. But it is getting hip to the trends in the scientific community. &ldquo;Communication, interaction is so important in all of this,&rdquo; Enserink says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the interesting thing about ResearchGate. People have ideas, they want to ask scientists, &#8216;Could it be this? Has anyone tried that?&#8217;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what happened on ResearchGate when the Ebola outbreak struck. Mohamad-Ali Trad, a Lebanese-born doctor based in Singapore, posted an idea on ResearchGate for a system that would let Ebola sufferers find help by sending a text message to an automated server. The server would then send back the address of the nearest treatment facility, along with the number of available beds. &ldquo;This could prevent patients from driving around to different hospitals and risking the spread of the disease,&rdquo; Trad says. In a matter of days, his post helped connect him to an African doctor who had worked on a similar system for AIDS patients, as well as a handful of potential funders.<\/p>\n<p>While the world has been growing ever more interconnected scientists have been encouraged to dig deeper into their narrow fields of research, which can leave them isolated. &ldquo;With ResearchGate we are trying to get them back together again,&rdquo; says Madisch. And with all that brainpower pooled together, he figures they will find breakthroughs far faster than they ever could alone.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\"

Setting up your profile allows you to upload all of the research you&rsquo;ve created in your lab into this cloud of scientists. Then you get all this feedback from other scientists on your data and on your research publications. You can also search the database of publications from all the other scientists. That&rsquo;s the basic product.<\/p>\n<p>Already we have a community of 5 million scientists using the network from every country in the world from all disciplines, and the number of publications uploaded onto our network has been increasing exponentially. It&rsquo;s now about 2 million publications uploaded every four weeks. There are 10,000 scientists signing up per day. And if you look at all the publications in the major scientific journals between 2011 and 2014, 69% of them have at least one author who is an active user of ResearchGate.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>Was that your elevator pitch to Bill Gates and the other big Silicon Valley investors who are helping to finance ResearchGate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you tell the story of opening science and making science more connected, it&rsquo;s clear for every venture capitalist &ndash; as long as they don&rsquo;t think in a one, two or three year timespan &ndash; that this can be something very big. Bill Gates immediately understood that this can have a huge impact, not only on science but also on the whole society we live in.<\/p>\n<p><strong>German Chancellor Angela Merkel also visited your offices last year. What was her interest in the project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think Angela Merkel understands that the digital economy will be an important part of Germany&rsquo;s economy. And we have slept for a long time. We have a lot of interesting start-ups in Berlin who just copied ideas in the U.S. and they were pretty successful in the German scene. But to build up a real start-up scene you need a game-changer, and I think right now is the right time. When we moved to Berlin from Boston [in 2010], it was really the perfect timing for us. In the last few years we have really built it up. And I think this is what Angela Merkel is noticing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So how is ResearchGate a gamechanger?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In science right now it&rsquo;s all about what you publish, where you publish it, and how much money you [get] after the publication. This is what we want to change. We want to change the behavior that [leads] scientists to think, &lsquo;Well, we need to close all the data into our four walls until we have publishers, because we want all the [credit] for it, before someone else gets to it.&rsquo; In the end, this is wrong. If we have found something out, we should go out with it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But what if your experiments are failures?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We need to let scientists think of negative results as positive results. We should not differentiate anymore. Any result you create is a result. We need the whole picture in science in order to have progress. And if we throw away 90% of what we&rsquo;re creating within a research project we are [making] the same mistakes again and again in the world, and wasting time and money because we don&rsquo;t know what other people have already tried. That&rsquo;s really bad. This is what we want to change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One of your mentors at the Medical School in Hanover, where you went to work as a doctor in 2007 after your research scholarship at Harvard, he tried to talk you out of developing ResearchGate. Why was he against it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He told me, &lsquo;Scientists are not social. This will never change. You&rsquo;re not changing it. You&rsquo;re 27, almost a professor, why are you throwing away your whole career?&rsquo; So I quit my job that night and went back to the U.S. to start building up ResearchGate. That was how the story started. Sometimes you need these barriers for yourself to understand that. If someone says no, it really motivates me even more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scientists, and the public at large, have been scrambling to understand the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. How has that been playing out on your social network?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ebola showed that if you analyze who is talking to whom you realize that this is very interdisciplinary. I think this is the only way to solve these problems. You get knowledge from different disciplines and not only from the virologists working on Ebola. This is where our concept of bringing scientists together is coming into the game.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty cool thing because at the end the only resource we cannot buy is time. That&rsquo;s the only thing that always limits us if we try to have progress. That&rsquo;s something where we try to be in the middle to make this [collaboration] more efficient, and it&rsquo;s working.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interview by Simon Shuster.

and present dangers &mdash; like the Ebola virus, terrorism and climate change &mdash; some burgeoning global threats can remain below the radar, garnering comparatively little attention. Among that group are ordinary bacteria that have developed such resistance to antibiotics that scientists refer to them as superbugs. The World Health Organization says bacterial resistance has reached &ldquo;alarming levels in many parts of the world&rdquo; and warns that the problem is so serious, it threatens the achievements of modern medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Among the researchers battling superbugs is Hosam Zowawi, a 30-year-old doctoral student in microbiology who decided to make drug-resistant bacteria the focus of his research after working as an infection-control trainee in a hospital in the Saudi city of Jeddah in 2006. Zowawi, who is a Saudi citizen, witnessed firsthand the problem of hospital-acquired infections: patients going into hospitals for crucial operations and acquiring infections there that led to disability and even death.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>Now studying at the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research (UQCCR) in Brisbane, Australia, Zowawi is working on developing a rapid diagnostic test to identify bacterial infections. He says the test will take only three or four hours to detect superbugs rather than the current average of three days. It is just months away from being ready for use, he says.<\/p>\n<p>Although the test relies on sophisticated, expensive machinery &mdash; which will limit its availability &mdash; Zowawi hopes it will be a first step toward ending the practice of doctors prescribing antibiotics on a trial-and-error basis because they don&rsquo;t have the ability to make a rapid diagnosis in emergency situations.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, the field of antimicrobial resistance research wasn&rsquo;t too competitive, says Zowawi. That&rsquo;s about to change. In July, the U.K.&rsquo;s Nesta Foundation offered its Longitude Prize, worth nearly $16 million, to scientists who could create a cheap, point-of-care test for bacterial infections. Two months later, the White House also announced a $20 million prize for the development of the same kind of rapid diagnostic tool. Zowawi believes this surge in interest is a sign that world leaders are finally taking the superbug threat seriously, a threat that currently kills nearly 50,000 people a year in the U.S. and Europe alone.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still a fair way from <em>Star Trek<\/em>, where they wave a device and get an instant result, but Hosam&rsquo;s work is significantly narrowing that gap,&rdquo; says Dr. David Looke, president of the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases.<\/p>\n<p>Zowawi&rsquo;s native Saudi Arabia and the surrounding Gulf states are among the regions of the world most impacted by superbugs. Poor prescription practices, a boom in medical tourism, and large numbers of both expatriates and refugees from conflict zones in the Middle East have all contributed a high prevalence of resistant bacteria in the region. Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at the Canberra Hospital, says the situation is worse in Saudi Arabia than it is in Australia. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotten to the point where many medical procedures can&rsquo;t be carried out because of fear of secondary infection,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/hosam-mamoon-zowawi-brisbane.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Hosam Mamoon Zowawi in his laboratory\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Claire Martin&mdash;INSTITUTE for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Once Zowawi began to focus his research on superbugs he quickly realized that there was an obvious lack of knowledge about the problem in the Gulf. &ldquo;This was an area that needed to be studied, if only to help paint a global picture,&rdquo; he says. Zowawi recently initiated a collaborative project between seven hospitals in the Gulf states, allowing them to share data to monitor the emergence of superbugs. He hopes it will develop into a formal superbug surveillance system, though this will require a lot more work and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>Zowawi is also raising awareness of the threat posed by antibiotic resistance in the Gulf states through an education campaign that began with him tweeting about the subject. He gives public lectures and makes appearances on television.<\/p>\n<p>Omar Baz, a junior researcher who volunteered at Zowawi&rsquo;s lab in Brisbane, says Zowawi taught him the importance of having goals. &ldquo;He is not going after superbugs for personal gain,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;What matters to him is making an impact.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In June, the Rolex Awards for Enterprise selected Zowawi as one of the watch manufacturer&rsquo;s five Young Laureates for 2014, kicking in nearly $60,000 to help him pursue his work. Currently on a full scholarship from the Saudi government, Zowawi plans on eventually returning to Saudi Arabia to set up a biotech firm, where he will continue the development of diagnostic tests as well as working with hospitals to help them identify bacterial infections.<\/p>\n<p>He believes the struggle against superbugs will be a long one. &ldquo;Even if we have new antibiotics, bacteria will figure out a way to overcome them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But if I wasn&rsquo;t optimistic, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this. I think we can tackle this.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\"

I realized there are many things in the world that we cannot really observe with the natural eye, yet they are very complicated and very interesting to study.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When did you decide to make superbugs the focus of your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ten years ago, I was at the end of my microbiology degree at Umm Al-Qura University in Saudi Arabia and doing a practical internship in a clinical laboratory. I started reading about cases in the medical world of people being infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>I decided to learn more about this [so I] worked as an infection control trainee in a hospital in Jeddah. Patients were going into hospitals for crucial operations like hip replacements or eye surgery and they would catch a superbug. These people were already very sick and suffering, and the last thing they needed was a subsequent infection given to them by the health care services that could lead to disability or even death. And it&#8217;s all avoidable. This realization was enough for me to pursue my first infection control research project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How big is the superbug threat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To this date we find them on every continent and in many different countries. The situation of superbugs is bad all over the world so the global attention is on. With my background [in Saudi Arabia] I know what&#8217;s going on there in terms of antibiotic use; people can buy antibiotics over the counter sometimes and I&#8217;ve seen a lot of hospital-acquired infections. So we focused our research on the Gulf to fill the gap in knowledge and research in that part of the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The image of health care in the Gulf is that it&#8217;s all quite clean, modern and advanced. But you&#8217;re saying health care workers&#8217; failure to clinically clean their hands &mdash; something we learned about a century ago &mdash; is contributing to superbug infections?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Compliance of hand-washing is low, but not just in the Gulf &mdash; all over the world, even in the most advanced countries. That is why in very fancy hospitals in the U.S. they have electronic devices that measure how frequently doctors wash their hands to enforce compliance. <strong>&#8232;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>What role can education play in the war against superbugs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I believe the general public has a huge role to play in battling superbugs worldwide, especially in places where people can buy antibiotics without medical consultation. Self-prescribing antibiotics can eradicate normal friendly bacteria that lives in our body and give evil bacteria the chance to move in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>One of the reasons superbugs are gaining so much ground is that no new class of antibiotics has been developed since 1987. Why don&#8217;t we make new ones anymore?<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A lot of pharmaceutical companies are stepping out of the business because they believe making antibiotics is not as profitable as making other drugs. But there are other regulatory reasons. The F.D.A. makes it very difficult for pharmaceutical companies. It takes 10 years and billions of dollars to take a chemical compound antibacterial properties from the lab through clinical trials and all the way to market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the worst-case scenario if governments and institutions stop investing in superbug research? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The worst-case scenario is we enter the post-antibiotic era which looks just like the pre-antibiotic era when people died from little things like cutting their hand or getting a sore throat. We would also lose almost all advanced forms of medicine. Heart transplant surgery, for example, depends on antibiotic treatment beforehand to prevent potential infections. We estimate the human lifespan has increased by up to 20 years because of antibiotics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And the best-case scenario? &#8232;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The best case is we don&#8217;t lose any more ground. The threat of superbugs will still be here but we will still have some antibiotics that work. Either way the war will never finish &mdash; my work will never finish &mdash; because even if we have new antibiotics, bacteria will figure out a way to overcome them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think you will continue to work in the field of antimicrobial resistance for the rest of your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of research that needs to be done and I am also very keen to work on different elements. I like to step away from my lab and talk to the general public, give speeches, but at the same time I need to get the work done.<\/p>\n<p>But I think we are in an excellent position. I am working with world-class researchers who know exactly what they are doing. They are giving me the freedom to pursue whatever is needed, with their guidance, and that is such a valuable thing. I think through collaboration, teamwork and funding to maintain the team, hopefully we can achieve this.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interview by Ian Lloyd Neubauer.

One staff member hands her a crate of cabbage and potatoes, prompting the 24-year-old to smile broadly. &ldquo;Oh, grand,&rdquo; she says. Ward won&rsquo;t be taking any of the produce home, though. The food is earmarked for a local charity.<\/p>\n<p>As the CEO and co-founder of FoodCloud, a nonprofit food-sharing service that connects businesses with charities seeking food donations, Ward spends many evenings in the Irish capital, Dublin, making sure the handovers go smoothly. It&rsquo;s that dedication that has helped turn FoodCloud, which launched in October 2013, into Ireland&rsquo;s only nationwide food-sharing charity, facilitating the donation of more than a ton of surplus food every day in a country still emerging from a financial crisis that has hit the poor particularly hard.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>FoodCloud works like this: Supermarkets or bakeries, which often have excess food, can sign up and at day&rsquo;s end use the service&rsquo;s app to upload details of any leftover food they wish to donate. A text message is then sent to local charities. If staff at a charity want to accept the donation, they can text back and collect the food.<\/p>\n<p>Ward was studying business at Trinity College Dublin when the idea for FoodCloud formed. She&rsquo;d been eyeing a lucrative career in finance but when she met Aoibheann O&rsquo;Brien, FoodCloud&rsquo;s co-founder, at a college event on food waste in 2012, something clicked. They were both dismayed that Ireland wastes a million tons of food each year while one in 10 people in the country go hungry.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;On the one side you have a load of food going to waste and on the other side you&rsquo;ve got people who don&rsquo;t enough to eat,&rdquo; says Ward. &ldquo;I really wanted to bring the two together.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before Ward and O&rsquo;Brien were able to successfully connect a Dublin charity to a local farmer&rsquo;s market, but they soon realized that playing matchmaker between charities and businesses was an enormous amount of work, particularly for two full-time students. Scaling their idea in order to become a functional charity and make a lasting impact would take a lot of time and work.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The big break was when Iseult graduated and she applied for [LaunchBox],&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Brien, referring to a start-up accelerator program. &ldquo;Everything changed when we had that full-time power behind it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>LaunchBox offered office space, business mentorship and a salary, which meant Ward had time to cold-call businesses, to research Ireland&rsquo;s charity industry, and to streamline donations by having an app built.<\/p>\n<p>She also tackled the red tape surrounding handling food. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think it would just be like pizza delivery, but it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; says Ward. &ldquo;Everyone has to be trained in food safety.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/iseult-ward-ceo-foodcloud.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Iseult Ward, founder and CEO of Irish company Foodcloud\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Kim Haughton for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>For guidance she turned to charity-sector veteran Brendan Dowling, a local community volunteer in Dublin. He was impressed with FoodCloud and he happily offered advice on navigating bureaucracy and networking. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great sense of authenticity,&rdquo; he says of Ward. &ldquo;There is a passion there.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Dowling loved FoodCloud&rsquo;s use of technology so much that his community center soon &ldquo;mirrored their concept.&rdquo; He now uses a mass text service to alert local families when there&rsquo;s a donation through FoodCloud &ndash; and is able to connect with nearly 200 families as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it isn&rsquo;t just technology that has bolstered FoodCloud; Ward&rsquo;s business education has helped make the service self-sustainable. &ldquo;We were very focused on getting a revenue model that worked,&rdquo; she says, so they could avoid time-consuming fund-raising. FoodCloud charges larger participating businesses to take away their surplus food. Ward says it&rsquo;s still a win for the big donors because FoodCloud is helping them reduce waste disposal costs.<\/p>\n<p>In July, FoodCloud announced a partnership with Tesco, the biggest supermarket chain in Ireland. By February, all of Tesco&rsquo;s 146 stores across Ireland will be making donations.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;What we loved was how innovative it was and how simple an idea it was,&rdquo; says Christine Heffernan, Tesco Ireland&rsquo;s corporate affairs director, adding that the food retailer has paid FoodCloud &euro;250,000 ($312,00) for a year&rsquo;s contract. That investment has meant that Ward and O&rsquo;Brien have been able to hire a staff of four. FoodCloud is also launching trials with two other major supermarkets in Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just businesses and charities that have recognized the difference FoodCloud has made. This month, Ward and O&rsquo;Brien were awarded Social Entrepreneurs Ireland&rsquo;s Impact Award, which recognizes local projects with innovative solutions to social problems. The award not only acknowledges Ward&rsquo;s hard work, it also comes with &euro;100,000 ($125,000) prize and two years of business support, which will help FoodCloud to keep growing.<\/p>\n<p>Ward wants to keep expanding the reach of FoodCloud until the organization has all but eradicated food poverty in Ireland. It&rsquo;s a huge task &mdash; but so is Ward&rsquo;s appetite for change.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Want%20to%20Solve%20Hunger%20AND%20Food%20Waste%3F%20There%E2%80%99s%20an%20App%20for%20That%20%7C%20TIME&body=Want%20to%20Solve%20Hunger%20AND%20Food%20Waste%3F%20There%E2%80%99s%20an%20App%20for%20That%0A%0AWant%20to%20get%20surplus%20food%20to%20the%20hungry%3F%20Ireland%E2%80%99s%20Iseult%20Ward%20has%20an%20app%20for%20that%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3583520%2Fshareable-feast%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3583520%2Fshareable-feast%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f2eI&text=Want%20to%20solve%20hunger%20AND%20food%20waste%3F%20There%27s%20an%20app%20for%20that&via=TIMEWorld\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3583520%2Fshareable-feast%2F&title=Want+to+Solve+Hunger+AND+Food+Waste%3F+There%E2%80%99s+an+App+for+That\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3583520\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583520\/shareable-feast\/\" data-title=\"Want to Solve Hunger AND Food Waste?

What made you want to go into the charity sector?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In February 2012, I went along to an event in college and I met Aoibheann O&#8217;Brien, the co-founder of FoodCloud and we got talking basically about how much food is wasted and how little is happening in Ireland [to combat that]. There was only one tiny, registered food bank in Ireland at the time and internationally, like in the U.K. and Europe, there are networks of food banks that were dealing with the problem. So we both thought that we&rsquo;d work on it and do something together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you first go about tackling the problem?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At first we started calling businesses and charities just to see if they wanted to do something like this &ndash; where the businesses would donate their surplus food to charities. We actually started out by connecting a local farmer&rsquo;s market to a local charity so that every Wednesday and Saturday, at the end of the day, the charity would come over to the farmer&rsquo;s market and pick up any food they had left. Now this was without using technology or anything. It was literally just matchmaking. We realized that if we wanted to expand, we&rsquo;d need to do more than picking up the phone and matching businesses.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>How did you build the app?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We outsourced it to a small Irish company, iCloud Mobile Application. We went to them with the idea and they built it for us. There&rsquo;s a content management system on it as well so each evening we have one of ourselves on call, basically, watching the app and making sure all the donations go out and are accepted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are other food-sharing programs out there in the U.S. and the U.K. How is FoodCloud different?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s different because we were very focused on getting a revenue model because we knew then we could focus our efforts on providing a really good service and we wouldn&rsquo;t have to spend all our time fund-raising.<\/p>\n<p>So that really shaped how we worked. And then I suppose it&rsquo;s our use of technology. We knew from day one, when we first left that farmer&rsquo;s market, that if we really wanted to scale what we were doing we were going to have to turn to technology. So I suppose that being very focused on technology and revenue is what makes us quite different from other charities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there anyone who guided you or supported you when you were starting out?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I suppose [FoodCloud&rsquo;s co-founder] Aoibheann [O&rsquo;Brien], actually, because we spent so much time together and there was just the two of us for a long time, so we really would have learned a lot [from one another]. She was doing a Master&rsquo;s when we met in university and so she brought a lot of experience with her. Since I was fresh out of college, I would have learned a lot from her, especially in the early days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You guys have expanded across Ireland and even internationally with a project up in Belfast. How much extra work has that meant for you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We just had the launch for Belfast recently and that&rsquo;s our first kind of franchise, I guess you could say. They&rsquo;re managing it themselves, so it&rsquo;s like a social franchise, which we&rsquo;re working on developing in partnership with a business in the community in Belfast.<\/p>\n<p>And then in Ireland we&rsquo;re expanding ourselves so it&rsquo;s our team here that is basically on the phone all the time looking for charities across Ireland to sign up and then going out and visiting the Tesco stores and launching FoodCloud within the stores.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did the partnership with Tesco come about?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>They were one of our first businesses, from back when we were literally cold-calling up everyone in Ireland trying to get businesses to sign up with the app. So we were just very lucky Tesco said they would have a meeting with us. We literally just went into a Tesco and said that we had heard feedback from charities and we [want to start] working with you. They agreed to do a trial in one of their stores and then they expanded the trial. In July, we entered into a national partnership with them so at the moment we&rsquo;re expanding into their 146 stores across Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much food are you sharing per week?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s expanding week-on-week but last week I heard it was about eight and half tons. So we&rsquo;re moving more than a ton of food a night at the moment. It&rsquo;s crazy how fast it&rsquo;s grown.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interview by Megan Gibson.

nondescript office building in the center of S&atilde;o Paulo is a circular, glass-walled classroom lined with yellow armchairs. If the aesthetic and layout are reminiscent of Silicon Valley, that&rsquo;s entirely intentional. Welcome to FazINOVA, a private business school founded in 2013 by 26-year-old entrepreneur Bel Pesce, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who is trying to inject dotcom, can-do energy into the Brazilian economy.<\/p>\n<p>FazINOVA &mdash; or DoINNOVATE, in English &mdash; is as much a start-up as a college and is intended to act as an example to its students, many of whom come from an emergent lower middle class into which millions of poor Brazilians have migrated over the last decade. They are now trying to tap into Brazil&rsquo;s growing entrepreneurial sector and so far, nearly 70,000 students have taken the for-profit school&rsquo;s free online classes. Almost 2,000 more have paid to attend six-month-long courses at FazINOVA&rsquo;s premises in S&atilde;o Paulo.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>&ldquo;Lots of people worry about the content,&rdquo; she says, sizzling with an energy former students describe as contagious. &ldquo;We worry about how we make people feel. If we make people feel empowered, they can do more and more.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Brazil&rsquo;s most prestigious universities are free to attend but take young people out of the workforce for several years &mdash; a luxury many of the students at FazINOVA can&rsquo;t afford. The academic bar to entry at traditional universities is also prohibitively high for Brazilians who did not do well in secondary school. That leaves Pesce with a large potential pool of budding entrepreneurs who don&rsquo;t quite fit into Brazil&rsquo;s structured society.<\/p>\n<p>In Silicon Valley, failure is seen as an important part of the learning curve. In Brazil, Pesce says, if you fail, you&rsquo;re out. &ldquo;We have a huge problem with mindset,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;How can you create innovation if you don&rsquo;t let people take risks?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Pesce was well known in Brazil even before she founded the school. At the age of 17, she persuaded MIT to accept her even though her application had come in late. She funded her education by teaching math, building robots and taking paid internships at Google and Microsoft. Later she worked in Silicon Valley as a product manager at Ooyala, an Internet video company, and then as part of the team that launched the mobile wallet app Lemon.<\/p>\n<p>Her experiences provided the material for a book, <em>The Girl From The Valley: How Entrepreneurship Can Change Your Life<\/em>, which took her by surprise when it was downloaded a million times within months of release, going on to sell 53,000 hardcopies and top Brazil&rsquo;s bestseller list in 2012. Pesce returned to Brazil from California in 2013 and published two more books, bringing total downloads of the three books to more than three million.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/bel-pesce-entrepreneur.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"Young entrepreneur and writer Bel Pesce\" \/><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Luiz Maximiano for TIME<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Once Pesce realized that Brazilians were passionate about the messages in her books, she decided to open FazINOVA as a way to spread the gospel of entrepreneurship directly.<\/p>\n<p>After studying at the school, 44-year-old Ezequiel Borges left his job at a major computer company to launch a logistics consultancy in Goi&acirc;nia, in central of Brazil. &ldquo;I learned to listen more, to be educated, to receive criticism,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Pesce&#8217;s timing is good. Interest in education is huge; it is the 10th-largest sector in the Brazilian economy, generating about $75 billion annually, $12.5 billion of that from private institutions like hers.<\/p>\n<p>Pesce says Brazil needs to change long-term attitudes that hold it back. One is a tendency to focus on problems that constrain business &mdash; such as labyrinthine bureaucracy and high taxes &mdash; rather than solutions. Pesce believes the country is ready for the kind of changes she advocates, citing as evidence her recent speaking engagement in Campo Grande, deep in Brazil&rsquo;s interior, attended by 50 high school students who had travelled about 180 miles on a Friday night to hear her speak. &ldquo;The kids didn&rsquo;t blink,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Brazil wants this.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Reinaldo Normand, a Silicon Valley-based Brazilian entrepreneur and writer, praises Pesce for encouraging Brazilians to start their own businesses. &ldquo;She believes in transforming education, which is important to the country, but she has her own way of doing it, with entrepreneurism,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>With Brazil&rsquo;s economy slowing down &mdash; and no longer able to simply ride a global commodity boom &mdash; that kind of innovative energy may be exactly what the country needs.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a

for a TV show to talk about the things I learned at a TED conference; I can start a hangout or a video conference every two weeks and people help me shape that program. So it&rsquo;s really participative. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the Internet, my book wouldn&rsquo;t have been what it was. So when you give something that has a lot of quality content for free, the word of mouth is really strong. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a big believer in free. And then you monetize.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are Brazilians so connected to the Internet?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Brazil is a very connected country. Not just with me. I think we see on the Internet a map of how people are in their everyday lives. People need people here. They love talking and they love discussing things.

Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting moment because there are so many problems, but these problems become huge opportunities. There is a lot we can do. There&rsquo;s a lot we can do to offer just like basic things for people to learn how to read and write. Sometimes people know how to read and write but they don&rsquo;t really understand what they&rsquo;re reading there. There&rsquo;s a lot of people who say, &#8220;Great, so I went to college, but I didn&rsquo;t learn anything that is a true skill for putting my dreams to be true.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What needs to change?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If someone is 18 today they will have five careers in their life &mdash; not jobs, careers. But the most important part is that three out of these five don&rsquo;t exist yet. Whoever works in social media today, 10 years ago it didn&rsquo;t exist, or whoever builds mobile apps, 15 years ago it didn&rsquo;t exist. So we need to change. There&rsquo;s no way at 17 or 18 people are going to make a final decision. People need to learn how to learn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You talk about the Louis CK skit in which the comedian satirizes a world spoiled by too much easy technology. What can we learn from it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The biggest differentiator is how you behave, the more and more technology and information becomes democratized, and the more and more you can get things in a faster way, a cheaper way, and a more approachable way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You talk a lot about the importance of long-term plans. What&rsquo;s yours for FazINOVA?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We want to learn how people achieve and how people don&rsquo;t achieve dreams, through whom, with what content, with which tools, and when someone else comes in with the same dream, we have some first steps they can take to try and get going in their dream. On all steps, from learning how to cook to traveling the world, from adopting a child to finishing a degree at MIT.<\/p>\n<p><i>Interview by Dom Phillips.

Bowen can&rsquo;t get us out of the parking lot. Which is odd, because he is precociously competent at a lot of other things. In April, at the age of 22, he stepped down as the head of a multimillion-dollar research project to found a pioneering biomedical startup. We are trying to drive from his office to the Beijing construction site that will soon be his lab. &ldquo;Take a right,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Or maybe it&rsquo;s a left?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Forgive the lapse: Zhao is new to the area. After spending five years at one of the country&rsquo;s top biotech companies, BGI Shenzhen, Zhao moved to the Chinese capital this year to build his own firm, QuantiHealth. His team members are now designing their digs from the ground up, with an eye to efficiency and SiliconValley&ndash;style dynamism. They zip across the office park on mini motorized unicycles, occasionally wheeling up to the nearby McDonald&rsquo;s drivethrough for snacks &mdash; much to the shock of the staff there.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>Zhao has a way of surprising people. Born and raised in Beijing, he tested in to Renmin, one of the country&rsquo;s most prestigious high schools. At 15, he started skipping &ldquo;the easy classes&rdquo; to sequence the genome of the cucumber at a nearby lab. Two years later he dropped out of school. It was an almost unthinkable move in China&rsquo;s regimented and competitive education system but one that perhaps signals a new willingness to break educational and career norms. He soon moved south to the city of Shenzhen and found work at BGI.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-related\" data-name=\"rr-related\"><div class=\"read-more-inline related\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3270907\/zhao-bowen-qa\/\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article data-event=\"rr-related\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/nextgen_bowen_qa.jpg?crop=129px%2C0px%2C1969px%2C1315px&#038;resize=560%2C374\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title\">Q&amp;A with Chinese Scientist Zhao Bowe<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Zhao&rsquo;s swift rise and cutting-edge work there is today the stuff of legend. But when he landed there at 17, the wide-eyed kid did not know what was in store. BGI gave him a bed in its dormitory, work in its labs, and a modest salary. It was lonely, but &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; &mdash; his favorite word. Months later, he was joined by a friend from Renmin, Ma Ge. When Zhao was given his own project to run, Ma joined his team: &ldquo;Bowen could talk to me about everything, stuff that you can&rsquo;t really talk to parents about,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>When they were not exploring the city&rsquo;s rock clubs, the two discussed science and philosophy, which was helpful because Zhao was soon leading a major international research effort. The goal was to use genomics to crack the code of human intelligence &mdash; to find out why some people, like Zhao, are so smart. Taking advantage of BGI&#8217;s fleet of high-powered DNA-sequencing machines, the team started testing samples from people with high IQ, searching vast amounts of data for tiny clues.<\/p>\n<p>The project made headlines around the world, in part because of concerns that the research might eventually enable parents to screen embryos in an effort to boost their future children&rsquo;s IQ. Zhao has clearly spent a lot of time considering these questions, but ventures, rather carefully, that fretting is premature and misses a key point: genes are only part of the picture. Based on what he has seen so far, he believes that genetics account for maybe 60% of our cognitive ability, as measured by IQ. The rest is learning and experience.<\/p>\n<p>This year Zhao decided to broaden his focus and go into business on his own. His new company will employ bioinformatics &mdash; the use of computer programming to analyze biological data &mdash; to study how the human body responds to environmental factors. Funded by private Chinese companies, QuantiHealth will work on developing quicker and more effective ways to evaluate health, both in terms of screening for risk and diagnosing diseases like diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>With the country&rsquo;s health care sector expected to boom &mdash; health spending is projected to grow from $357 billion in 2011 to $1 trillion in 2020, according to McKinsey &mdash; Zhao&rsquo;s new company is playing in an increasingly lucrative market. Zhao insists it is not really about the money, not yet. &ldquo;At this point, it&rsquo;s about ideas, &rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The idealistic emphasis on innovation may be standard fare in the Silicon Valley, but is less common in China. Though the ruling Chinese Communist Party talks about promoting entrepreneurship, the economy is still dominated by hulking state-owned-enterprises, and intellectual property is something of a free-for-all. There is a risk, of course, that Zhao&rsquo;s project will come alive only to be snared in a regulatory net, or otherwise controlled by the sprawling state. He counters that China&rsquo;s economic dynamism more than makes up for opaque regulations and fleets of would-be copycats: &ldquo;I would not want to be anywhere else,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Competition makes things better.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate his point, he asks Ma, now his assistant, to bring over &ldquo;the wheel&rdquo; &mdash; his motorized unicycle. The device was first developed in California, but a Shenzhen-based firm refined the design making it smaller, cheaper, and easier to use, he says. BGI was not the first to do genetic sequencing, but it was the first to do it on such a large scale; QuantiHealth aims to improve medical testing one small change at a time. &ldquo;Micro-innovation,&rdquo; Zhao says, looking down at the circular contraption. &ldquo;When people bother to copy you, you know you are doing something right.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>To celebrate this idea, and the startup, Zhao bought each of his new employees a wheel of their own. Together they spent a few weeks learning to ride the things &mdash; a process that left Zhao with a scrape on his right elbow. But it was fun. &ldquo;We went from nothing, to semi-pro, to almost pro, quite quickly,&rdquo; Zhao says, before giving the thing a whirl. I&rsquo;m not surprised to see him glide across the asphalt, arms outstretched, in a smooth, controlled arc. He learns fast.<\/p>\n<p><i>With reporting by Gu Yongqiang in Beijing<\/i><\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

am","short":"9\/12","hide_date":false},"content":"<p><strong>At just 22, you supervised a major genomics research project and are the founder of a health startup. How did you get to where you are?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I was born in Beijing and I got into high school, just like most of my friends. Then I started to be interested in biotechnology, and [during high school] I actually spent two years interning at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science. I got involved in a cucumber genome-sequencing project and I learned almost everything about genomics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You dropped out just short of graduation, at age 17 &mdash; why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I decided to move to Shenzhen and I worked at B.G.I. &mdash; it stands for Beijing Genomics Institute &mdash; and I stayed there for five years. I actually started a project researching the genetic basis of human intelligence.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>In Shenzhen I started a lab, the Cognitive Genomics Lab. It was a relatively new, multidisciplinary field. And what we study is basically about the variation of human cognition, or the difference in human IQ. We wish to see if there is a correlation between that and people&rsquo;s DNA.<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve collected a very large sample pool for two years and the samples are from all over the world. It is by far the largest research of its kind.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What can you tell us about the genetic basis of intelligence?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most important things to know is that scientists agree that about 60% of intelligence is inheritable. But that also means that 40% that could be trained and will change during your life. One thing I must point out is that these are not very strict lines and actually you could bring up that 40% line if you really work hard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So you can train your brain?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But we train what we are best at and we avoid touching the part that we are not good at. People all think that a guy with high IQ must do well at math, logic and other natural sciences, but they train themselves to fit into that expectation, and meanwhile they just didn&rsquo;t have the chance to train their social ability.<\/p>\n<p>I would advise [anyone] to try to think outside of the box, to try to think outside of the normal social expectations on you, because it is always possible that you could achieve something else &mdash; something that an IQ test would not tell us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Well, you are yourself obviously very intelligent &mdash; how much of that has to do with how you grew up?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is hard to say that my childhood was different. I would describe it as pretty normal, but I had a very strong curiosity about everything since I was really young. And my parents, they also encouraged me to find out the answers by myself. You know, every time I asked my Mom or my Dad, &lsquo;What is this, what is that?&rsquo; &mdash; I asked a lot of questions &mdash; they always tell me, &lsquo;Hmm I don&rsquo;t know, you really got me, you better find it out.&rsquo;<\/p>\n<p>So I learned to grab to grab the answers for my own questions at a really young age. That is, I believe, that is kind of special.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why does intelligence research generate so much controversy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I believe a lot of people think we&hellip; that we have plans to apply our results on the real world, but I have to say, as the director of this research, that we currently do not have such plans. If you want to do something real to your body &mdash; like raising IQ or measuring IQ only using DNA &mdash; those are just impossible right now.<\/p>\n<p>Human brains are the most complex objects in the universe. You can say that all our society&rsquo;s achievements, all the science, all the art, they come from the brain, but the mechanism behind that is still unknown. It was not until [recently] that we finally have the tools to understand that on a very basic scale. So that is what we were trying to do: We wish to understand the way our cognitive system works, from the genomics level.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And now you are also the founder of a new business, QuantiHealth. Is it difficult being a 22-year old boss?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Being young is always like a tag on me since I dropped out of high school and started to work at BGI five years ago. Being young means that people will not believe that you can do what you wish to do, or what you claimed to do, at least at first impression.<\/p>\n<p>It also means that once you prove that you could do something really different, you show people that you have no limit &mdash; and people will love to see you achieve things, and they will love to help you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So people have been happy to help you along?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You know, probably everyone had a dream about achieving something really different and really great when they were young. I can tell you that a lot people, a lot of people that are one or two generations older than me, they really helped me, they gave me a lot of things without taking anything back, they just wanted to support me to achieve dreams.<\/p>\n<p>I still have some of the childhood vision in my mind. I still wish to do a lot of things that seem impossible but are actually possible.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; interview by Emily Rauhala.

of the ironies of the 2011 revolution in Tunisia is that while it was a step forward for democracy, it has always threatened to be a step backwards for women&#8217;s rights. Many Tunisians are socially and religiously conservative, and the fall of the autocratic President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali gave them a political voice in their country for the first time. In the first free elections in the country history, in 2011, the moderate Islamist Ennahda party took more than a third of the votes, more than four times its nearest rival.<\/p>\n<p>And so when Ikram Ben Said set out to create an organization dedicated to women&#8217;s rights that year, it was clear to her that she would have to be inclusive if she was to be successful. Her organization, Aswat Nissa &mdash; or Voices of Women &mdash; is not the first in the country dedicated to women&#8217;s rights, but it&#8217;s the first to involve Tunisian women politicians regardless of where they fall of the political spectrum. &#8220;Feminism for me is not imposing my choice, my vision of society,&#8221; says the 34-year-old activist, who is president of Aswat Nissa. &#8220;Feminism is helping women achieving their dreams and assuming their responsibilities and their decisions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>Tunisia is progressive by the standards of the Arab world &mdash; the country was founded in 1957 with a Turkish-style project of modernization that included a commitment to women&#8217;s rights unparalleled in North Africa and the Muslim Middle East. In central Tunis, a woman is just as likely to be wearing jeans and a tight top as she is to have a scarf concealing her hair. But activists like Ben Said say the country&#8217;s laws still leave much to be desired. In matters of inheritance, sons and sometimes other male members of the family are favored over daughters. In a household, the father is the legal head of the family, giving him control over his wife and children. Muslim women can&#8217;t marry non-Muslims, a restriction that isn&#8217;t imposed on men.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-related\" data-name=\"rr-related\"><div class=\"read-more-inline related\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3270894\/ikram-ben-said-qa\/\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article data-event=\"rr-related\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/nextgen_ben_said_qa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2100px%2C1401px&#038;resize=560%2C374\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title\">Q&amp;A with Tunisian Women\u2019s Rights Activist Ikram Ben Said<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>One of the first events that Ben Said organized after forming Aswat Nissa was a conference at which participants discussed women&#8217;s political participation in Arab and Muslim history. &#8220;I strongly believe that God didn&#8217;t create me to be discriminated against and be massacred,&#8221; she says. &#8220;You can be Muslim and advocate for women&#8217;s equality. It&#8217;s not against Islam. This is what we try to explain to people.&#8221; Later, she launched a campaign to encourage women to vote, organising outreach efforts in rural areas and working class neighborhoods in particular. &#8220;There are a lot of very effective activists who can galvanize rooms, but usually they can galvanize rooms of activists,&#8221; says Hala Hanna, an associate director at the World Economic Forum, who has worked with Aswat Nissa in a private capacity, teaching women politicians. &#8220;What&#8217;s interesting about Ikram is that she&#8217;s able address all sorts of audiences.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Before the revolution, Ben Said volunteered in a shelter for single mothers, a group that often faces discrimination in Tunisia. She would sometimes spend nights in the shelter, bringing friends to cook and dance and sing. The experience provided Ben Said with a window into the lives of the women she was helping, but also a crucial insight: the women she was working with didn&#8217;t just need charity, but a change in the social and legal environment in which they were living. &#8220;Laws can change the mentality,&#8221; says Ben Said. &#8220;So we have to work with politicians.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Over the last two years, Aswat Nissa has organized courses for women politicians, including several from Ennahda, training them in the basics of politics and governing. &#8220;She&#8217;s an example of the modern Tunisian woman I&#8217;d like to follow: courageous, hard working, professional and also sweet,&#8221; says Ahlem Saidani Gharbi, a member of Ennahda. &#8220;Personally I have a lot of respect for her. I respect her neutrality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ben Said has a regular job &mdash; her position at Aswat Nissa is unsalaried &mdash; as a senior program manager at Search for Common Ground, an international non-profit agency. There, Ben Said has conceived and created a program orchestrating conversations between women groups that might normally be at odds. &#8220;In the U.S., you would say she can reach across the aisle,&#8221; says her boss, Abou El Mahassine Fassi-Fihri. &#8220;She&#8217;s equally accepted by the seculars and the Islamists.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ben Said grew up in a family on the conservative side of the political spectrum. Like many Tunisian women she doesn&rsquo;t wear a headscarf, but her mother and her two sisters do. Her father was a military officer, with whom she often disagreed. &ldquo;I learned from him that different opinions can live under one roof,&rdquo; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Asked where she sees herself in ten years, Ben Said answers that, depending on the circumstances, she could see herself in politics or in civil service, in Tunisia or abroad. Her friends and supporters and those she works with do not hesitate to say that they hope she will enter politics. For now though, says Ben Said, she will put any political or other ambitions on hold: her campaign to increase women&#8217;s participation in Tunisian politics is far from over.<\/p><aside

explain to them that their vote counts. We also work on [increasing the] political participation of women, so we help women, we support them, and we encourage them to run for office on the legislative level and the local level. And we also work against violence against women.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest issues of disagreement among Tunisian politicians?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Each group feels like it is threatened by the other. Seculars don&#8217;t want to see Islamists. For them, they are not Tunisian. They have another agenda. They are retrograde. And Islamists see seculars as also having another agenda, a Western agenda, against our identity as Arabs and Muslims.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>You train female politicians from all of Tunisia&#8217;s major political parties. What do these women have in common?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First, they are all Tunisian women. They share the same history. They share the same future, because they&#8217;re obliged to live together here. All of them are proud to be Tunisian. Also, they are victims of discrimination in their political parties. [Whether they&rsquo;re] in Islamist or secular political parties, I think that women suffer from the same discrimination. They are not in the leadership in the political parties. They are not in the leadership of the government. So I think they can [fight] together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One of the first things you did after forming Aswat Nissa was explore the role of women in Muslim and Arab Heritage. What did you discover?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We learned that there is not one Islam. There are many Islams. You can be Muslim and advocate for women&#8217;s equality. It&#8217;s not against Islam. This is what we try to explain to people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your definition of feminism?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Feminism for me is not imposing my choice, my vision of society. Feminism is helping women in achieving their dreams and assuming their responsibilities and their decisions. Feminism is also a matter of diversity. When we chose the name Aswat Nissa, [which means] &#8220;Voices of Women&#8221;, we [wanted] &#8220;voices&#8221; because there are many voices, there is not one voice, and &#8220;women&#8221; because they are very different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You participated in the early days of the Tunisian revolution. Can you take us back to those days, how it started and how it went for you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was in front of the [trade union headquarters in Tunis in December 2010]. We were a few people surrounded by the police. It was raining and we were singing. It [sounds] like a romantic story, but I was scared. I was very, very afraid, but at the same I said to myself, I should stay here. My place is here.<\/p>\n<p>And then [on] January 14 [there] was the general strike. I remember I was in the street, and my phone rang and [it was] my mom who told me, &#8220;There is a demonstration now, I&#8217;m watching it on Al Jazeera, so please go home. I&#8217;m scared.&#8221; And then my sister took the phone [from my mother]. She said, &#8220;No, no, please stay. We need people there.&rdquo; And I was confused because my mom was afraid, because she&#8217;s a mom. And my sister &mdash; she&#8217;s this new generation, full of hope, with very high expectations. So I [thought], I cannot disappoint her and I cannot disappoint myself and I cannot disappoint all this generation. So I stayed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you could change one thing about Tunisia what would it be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Gender equality. I would put it in the constitution [so] that from the beginning women are equal to men and be very severe on that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which global figures have inspired you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first one is Nelson Mandela, and the second is Martin Luther King. And the reason they inspire me is that both were human rights activists, but in a very inclusive way, in a very constructive way. So each time I have doubts about my approach, I remember their stories and that gives me a lot of positive energy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You say you&#8217;re hopeful for the future of Tunisia. What is it that makes you hopeful?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I see people in Aswat Nissa, very committed, very involved, to help support women and to empower women, that gives me lots of positive energy. Everyone who wants to make change should definitely be optimistic. Because when you have a vision and you have the passion and you have the drive, you can inspire people and make things happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see yourself ten years from now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It depends on the political situation. Maybe I will stay in the civil society. Maybe I will create a think tank or a Tunisian women&rsquo;s lobby. Maybe I will be in politics.

He stares at it intently, watching a few seconds of a new music video on the website of the company he founded and runs, <a href=\"http:\/\/sbtv.co.uk\/\">SB.TV<\/a>. Edwards, 24, isn&rsquo;t being rude &mdash; YouTube and online music videos are the lifeblood of his business, and he needs to keep on top of the latest music clips if he&rsquo;s going to keep SB.TV a major player in the digital world. The business community seems to believe he&rsquo;s up to the task. The swish boardroom? It belongs to Miroma Ventures, a London-based private-equity firm that last year took a stake in SB.TV for an undisclosed sum.<\/p>\n<p>Edwards has built SB.TV into the U.K.&rsquo;s leading online youth-content provider. It began in November 2006 as a YouTube channel showcasing both up-and-coming musicians and established stars. Three years later Edwards created a separate website to host the videos as well as audio, and written interviews and articles on fashion, music and sports. SB.TV makes most of its money from YouTube&rsquo;s advertising revenue, of which it gets a percentage, though the website also sells merchandise. Right now SB.TV has close to half a million YouTube subscribers. Edwards, with Miroma&rsquo;s help, plans to take SB.TV to the U.S. and South Africa while also expanding its coverage of fashion and sports. &ldquo;I still think there&rsquo;s so much more to do,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>But Edwards is not just an entrepreneur who&rsquo;s in it to win it. He wants to help other young people with good business ideas and the sort of entrepreneurial energy he exudes. To that end, Edwards volunteers for three British organizations that focus on nurturing youths, including the Prince&rsquo;s Trust, a charity established by Prince Charles. &#8220;People look up to me,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It gives me more buzz to keep on going.&#8221;<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-related\" data-name=\"rr-related\"><div class=\"read-more-inline related\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3270911\/jamal-edwards-qa\/\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article data-event=\"rr-related\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/nextgen_edwards_v.jpg?w=560&#038;h=374&#038;crop=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title\">Q&amp;A with Online Music Video Mogul Jamal Edwards<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>Michael Maynard, a media-studies student at Northenden College in Manchester, met Edwards last summer at a music festival in the northern English city. Maynard, who was launching a clothing brand, gave Edwards a T-shirt as a gift. &ldquo;He thanked me and told me I&rsquo;d see him wearing it in the next few days,&rdquo; Maynard says. &ldquo;A few days later he wore the T-shirt in an interview with Miley Cyrus. Since then I have looked up to him even more.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Edwards&rsquo; journey to becoming an impresario began at age 15, when his parents gave him a video camera for Christmas. He began filming wild foxes roaming in his backyard in West London before expanding to shooting family and friends. Eager to share his videos, particularly those of his friends rapping or singing, he started uploading his content to YouTube, then in its infancy, under the name SB.TV&mdash;the SB stands for SmokeyBarz, Edwards&rsquo; rap name&mdash;and was amazed to see the videos get thousands of views. Edwards soon began filming interviews or impromptu performances by well-known musicians outside clubs and hotels. SB.TV&rsquo;s online traffic grew rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>Another music entrepreneur who started young, Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, says he has seen strong leadership qualities in Edwards, whom he has advised. &ldquo;I was impressed by his confidence the first time I met him,&rdquo; Branson says. &ldquo;I saw firsthand just how keen young people were to look to him for inspiration.&rdquo; Edwards may have some way to go before he reaches Branson&rsquo;s level of success &mdash; but with endorsements like that, it would be unwise to bet against him.<\/p><aside

Why do you think it was so popular?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was a niche. No one was really doing it in like 2005, 2006. YouTube was bought by Google in November 2006 and I remember that&#8217;s when I started uploading my first videos. I think that&#8217;s what made it so special. Because I was, sort of, [there] at the beginning. When you used to go on YouTube it was like &ldquo;Charlie Bit My Finger&rdquo;<em> <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash;<\/span> <\/em>loads of comedy videos, just millions of funny videos, but there was never original music content. There might have been music content that was taken from TV and put online but it was never someone that filmed it solely for online, and that&#8217;s what I was offering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would you consider yourself an inspirational person?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I do, but I wouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Oh, I inspire everyone on the planet.&#8221; People always tweet me <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash;<\/span> or if they see me on the street <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash;<\/span> and say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re inspirational.&#8221; It sort of gives me more buzz to keep on going because people look up to me and aspire to be [like me].<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>Who inspires you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Family and friends. Richard Branson&#8217;s a big inspiration. I like Kevin Hart, I like the way he&#8217;s built his brand from <em>Soul Plane <\/em>to smashing it now above many comedians. Dr. Dre with his story from NWA to now selling Beats by Dre. And being on tour with him, Jimmy Iovine, Snoop Dogg and will.i.am for a week just completely inspired me. We went around Asia <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash;<\/span> Singapore, Taiwan. Seven places in seven days. It was just hardcore. I was ill for a week when I got back, but it sort of showed me how hard they work, even though they&#8217;re proper successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is the biggest mistake you&#8217;ve ever made?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the Dr. Dre tour I lost the footage [I had shot] and didn&#8217;t back it up. [Dre had] phoned me up and said, &#8220;Come on tour.&#8221; I should have said, &#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll be the director and I need a cameraman,&#8221; because I was carrying everything. It was intense for me to be traveling all these places by myself, it was mad. When I got back, my hard drive failed. That was probably one of the biggest mistakes, not to back it up and not to actually speak up and say, &#8220;I need another person to come with me on the trip.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re interviewing superstars, you&#8217;ve gone on tour with Dr. Dre <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash; h<\/span>ow do you stay grounded?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how I stay grounded. I do though. I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve always had the same friends, that hasn&#8217;t changed. I do go through times when I hang around with glamorous people <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash;<\/span> I&#8217;m not going to mention names <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash;<\/span> but I do have friends who get papped everywhere. I think if I hung around with them all the time, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;d change.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In what ways are you a good leader?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I make decisions. Even small decisions [such as] who to feature on the channel or how to shoot it. Like, being hands-on with videos. I&#8217;ll go to shoots and people don&#8217;t expect me to turn up. That makes a good leader, to show that you&#8217;ve actually got time for your team. To show that you actually care about the work, to give them feedback, I think that&#8217;s very important. When you lose that, that&#8217;s when it all breaks down. I think being a good leader is as simple as getting involved.<\/p>\n<p><em>&mdash; interview by Mirren Gidda.

LRDE slum lies next to one of the southern Indian city&rsquo;s sprawling technology parks. Home to some 2,000 people, most of whom live in makeshift dwellings fashioned out of tarpaulin and plastic sheets, it is routinely flooded during the annual monsoon season, with heavy rains turning inundated homes into breeding grounds for diseases like malaria and typhoid.<\/p>\n<p>But thanks to 28-year-old architect Alok Shetty change is coming to LRDE. Working with the Bangalore-based nonprofit Parinaam Foundation, Shetty came at the problem with an approach he brings to all of his projects &mdash; marrying smart design with a commitment to sustainability. Conventional bricks-and-mortar houses would keep the water out. But they would also be too expensive for the slum-dwellers. Instead, Shetty designed new, flood-proof houses made out of discarded scaffolding, bamboo and wood. At $300 apiece &mdash; or just over a month&rsquo;s wages for many of LRDE&rsquo;s residents &mdash; they are both affordable and easy to set up. It takes only four hours to erect one of Shetty&rsquo;s new units (and the same time to dismantle them, a useful feature for the slum&rsquo;s population of itinerant laborers). For those who can&rsquo;t afford Shetty&rsquo;s new houses, he is seeking government subsidies to bring the price down further. &ldquo;He is an angel in disguise for our work with the underprivileged,&rdquo; says Mallika Ghosh, Parinaam&rsquo;s executive director.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>A Bangalore native, Shetty epitomizes a growing breed of young leaders and entrepreneurs in India who are committed to finding solutions for a country undergoing rapid social and economic changes, some of which can leave India&rsquo;s poorest straggling behind. Economic reforms in the early 1990s unlocked record levels of growth, and helped pull millions of Indians out of extreme poverty. But nearly a third of the population still survives on less than $1.25 a day, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). India ranks 135 out of 187 countries on the U.N.&rsquo;s human development index, a widely-followed gauge of social and economic progress. That places it behind other emerging giants such as China and Brazil, and only slightly ahead of Ghana and Bangladesh. Against this backdrop, Shetty has placed social concerns at the heart of his practice since his first year as a student of architecture.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-related\" data-name=\"rr-related\"><div class=\"read-more-inline related\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3270908\/alok-shetty-architect-india\/\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article data-event=\"rr-related\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/nextgen_shetty_qa.jpg?crop=25px%2C295px%2C2028px%2C1354px&#038;resize=560%2C374\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title\">Building Hope in India<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>When studying his craft at a local college, Shetty, then 19 years old, won a competition that led him to redesign a hospital in the northern city of Jaipur. Before drawing up blueprints, he spent months talking to the staff and patients, identifying their problems and incorporating solutions in his design. He discovered, for example, that post-operative patients were being wheeled through public corridors that they had to share with the recently deceased, leaving patients prone to infections. His solution: a service corridor to transport dead bodies and a separate, sterile corridor to move patients out of the operating theater. Drinking water was another problem, with Jaipur suffering from regular shortages in supply. Shetty&rsquo;s answer? Equipping the building with a rainwater-harvesting system to allow the hospital to build up its own reserves during the rains. &ldquo;He is a power house of futuristic ideas,&rdquo; says Jatin Hukkeri, an old friend who worked with Shetty on the Jaipur hospital project.<\/p>\n<p>The seeds for his latest venture &mdash; a plan to boost access to healthcare and education in remote communities &mdash; were sown while studying for his Master&rsquo;s in architecture at Columbia University in New York. There, <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Shetty, along with two friends, designed a shipping container that opens up to become a 250-seat mobile auditorium<\/span>. Back in India, Shetty has adapted the design to create mobile clinics and classrooms that he says can be attached to trains. The idea is to use the country&rsquo;s vast rail network &mdash; one of the world&rsquo;s third largest, with nearly 70,000 miles of track &mdash; to bring basic services to distant regions. Many rural areas, for example, are severely lacking when it comes to the availability of health services, with 70% of the country&rsquo;s health infrastructure concentrated in its top 20 cities. Shetty is building prototypes now and hopes to launch the project, which he is funding through other architectural commissions, next year.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;In my travels I saw vast stretches of rural India where infrastructure for health care and education was severely underdeveloped,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Building facilities in these areas is not impossible but it is time-consuming. Adaptive architecture like this can be an extremely effective solution to help address our developmental problems.&rdquo; He is building prototypes now and next year hopes to launch the project, which he is funding through other architectural commissions. &ldquo;Often the simplest solutions are the best solutions,&rdquo; he says. If Shetty&rsquo;s prototype clears the testing phase next year, India&rsquo;s trains could soon be delivering ready-made clinics and schools all over the nation.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module

am","short":"9\/12","hide_date":false},"content":"<p><strong>Correction appended: <\/strong>Sept. 12.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You were chosen to design a multi-specialty hospital when you were just 19 years old. What was unique about your design?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While researching for the project, which was a design challenge at my architecture school in Bangalore, I realized how bad the existing layouts in Indian hospitals were. I spent months with doctors, nurses, patients and administration staff asking them what was wrong and what needed to be fixed. I based my design on that. They loved it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you develop an interest in sustainable architecture?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is no such thing as sustainable architecture. The act of building itself is damaging the earth. The only thing we can do is to try and limit the damage as much as possible. There is so much junk and waste in the world. We started with the question &ndash; how should we re-appropriate that?<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>And when exactly did you start thinking about reducing waste?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time at construction sites as a child as my father runs a construction business and [I had] always noticed a lot of waste that accumulated at these sites. Sometimes we could sell them for scrap but most times we had to pay someone to clear the debris and I thought there could be a way to use all this waste.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What kind of waste products are you using in your designs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We use discarded shipping containers. We are also experimenting with developing lightweight construction bricks from trash. The idea is to use them in earthquake-prone areas so even if buildings fall, the damage would be limited.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did your award-winning design for the Black Box Theater come about?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That was again a design challenge posed to [my class at Columbia University] by TED Talks asking us to design an auditorium for the spoken word that can go anywhere. It&rsquo;s a 40-foot shipping container that completely opens itself out to become a 250-seat auditorium in around four hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you developed that design idea any further? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In India the biggest connection is the railways. We have developed the concept of the Black Box Theater further to come up with foldable mobile schools and health clinics. The idea is to attach them to train compartments. They get dropped off at a village and then the next train comes and picks it up. In between it opens up to become a school or a health clinic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You also have unique housing solutions for India&rsquo;s slum dwellers. What do they entail?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Slum dwellers in India are mostly construction workers. They live in makeshift homes made of tarpaulin sheets as most of the time they are squatters and could be evicted at any point. Which is why it is very important for them to have houses that are portable. We developed a model where we ask the building developers for 5% of their scaffolding. We take the scaffolding and jack it up one foot above the ground and then [add] bamboo and wood. The units can house a family of four, which can be set up in four hours and can be carried around.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your designs also have an overlay of ancient Indian architecture. Is that deliberate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In ancient India, passive cooling was very important. You analyze wind patterns, where the sun rises and sets so you kind of know all the factors. So you turn the building to make the windows face where the winds are [coming from]. We just finished a hotel project in Bangalore and we designed a fa&ccedil;ade or skin in front of the building, which is almost porous in nature so it harnesses the wind power and tunnels it in the building, cooling it down [and] bringing down energy and air conditioning cost by almost 30%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your other design influences?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am also much influenced by the Japanese concept of <em>kaizen<\/em>, meaning good change, where they take up a perfectly functioning product and then break it down and rebuild it to make it better. It&rsquo;s called the continuous improvement of processes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest challenges?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a history of buildings being over-designed in India in terms of structure &ndash; excess concrete, excess steel in every building. And I often work with veterans in the industry, who are extremely set in their ways and resist change. They want to stick to doing what they were doing 30-40 years back, because it lessens their work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are your architectural solutions different from what&rsquo;s happening in India at the moment?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have an extremely unique approach in that we don&rsquo;t look at aesthetics; we only look at problem solving.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you fund your projects?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We make our money from run-of-the-mill projects so we can work on socially useful projects. So we set aside one day each week brainstorming projects that would add value to the society. The slum development project came up during one of those days. But what we are doing is not charity. I don&rsquo;t think charity does anyone any good. It only makes people lazy. Sure, we waive our architecture and design fees. But we sell the final product at a subsidized cost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your dream project?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After [we designed] the hospital in Jaipur, we designed small clinics for women and children in rural areas, developing a bamboo model based on WHO&rsquo;s AIDS camps in Rwanda where they plant bamboo, which grows by three feet every day, in a circle and then they put a sheet over it. It grows to become a hut. But because of funding issues it couldn&rsquo;t be implemented. I would love to do it someday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have there been times when you have questioned your work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was recently in a rain forest and I went on a long trek and met tribal [communities] who inhabit the area and witnessed how fiercely they protect their land. It hit me at that time that I am actually someone who is part of the industry contributing to taking these forests down. That makes me question all our design practices and ask how can we change it, how can we improve it and most importantly how we can make our footprint even more minimal.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash; <em>interview by Nilanjana Bhowmick. This interview has been edited and condensed.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Correction<\/strong>: The original version of this story misstated the group that received the design challenge which resulted in the Black Box Theater.

A mentor and carer who might expose them to new experiences, a person who was not a member of their family and who might make them feel less isolated from society and their peers. The idea for a new youth movement was born, and she named it Krembo Wings. (A Krembo is a chocolate-covered marshmallow treat popular among Israeli children.)<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>After just one year of recruiting people and funds, Altschuler found herself running an organization that had four branches in four cities and town and 100 participants. Today, 11 years later, Krembo Wings has 35 branches across Israel with over 3,000 volunteers in any given year running after-school activities for children with special needs. The teenage participants run most of the organization and pass it on to others when they graduate high school.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-related\" data-name=\"rr-related\"><div class=\"read-more-inline related\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3270784\/adi-altschuler-qa\/\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article data-event=\"rr-related\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/nextgen_altschuler_qa.jpg?crop=0px%2C133px%2C2100px%2C1401px&#038;resize=560%2C374\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title\">Q&amp;A with Israeli Social Entrepeneur Adi Altschuler<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>&ldquo;In the beginning, we were just a bunch of 16-year-olds. We didn&rsquo;t know how to say vision or strategy or business plan,&rdquo; says Altschuler, 27, speaking at her home in Tel Aviv.<\/p>\n<p>Israel is a country often in the news for its conflicts with its neighbors and for internal tensions, even between Israeli Jews. But there&#8217;s a less immediately visible Israel that thrives even while the conflicts continue to flare &#8211; an Israel of high-tech start-ups, a thriving cultural scene and a burgeoning social entrepreneurship movement. Altschuler is part of that Israel. Krembo Wings has become a model of the country&#8217;s contemporary strain of volunteerism. Altschuler now mentors other social entreprenuers and has more recently founded an organization that encourages Israelis to think differently about the impact of the Holocaust. Her day job also lets her contribute to Israeli society <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash; she&#8217;s<\/span> the Israel manager of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.co.il\/edu\/\">Google for Education<\/a>, a Google department she says trains tens of thousand of Israeli teachers in new ways of teaching and integrating technology in classrooms &ldquo;to make learning magical again.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But it is Krembo Wings, from which she is now stepping down as president, that put her on the map as an innovator. In 2009, she and Krembo Wings were awarded one of Israel&rsquo;s most respected prizes, the Presidential Award for Volunteerism. (<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Kfir passed away six years ago, but Altschuler stays in regular touch with his mother.<\/span> <span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Altschuler says it is Kfir&#8217;s mother, Claudia, who has had the greatest influence on her. &#8220;She&#8217;s one of the most creative people I ever met,&#8221; she says. &#8220;She always found ways for Kfir to be a part of things.<\/span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&#8220;)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Many of the people Altschuler has worked with say she has helped them find their own paths in social activism. Shir Lazarovits, 18, recently stepped down as the head of the Krembo Wings branch in Modi&rsquo;in, a city halfway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Not only does she look up to Altschuler as a role model, but says the leadership opportunity Krembo Wings afforded her has changed her life.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;To give a girl of 16 the responsibility for 70 or more volunteers and all the special-need kids involved is incredible: You feel that you&rsquo;re in charge of something important and it makes you grow up fast. You learn about management and how to deal with the difficult situations. Adults tell me they had to get to the age of 30 to get to a position of being responsible for so many people,&rdquo; says Lazarovits. &ldquo;Adi convinced me that I can do great things going forward. She doesn&rsquo;t rest. It&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s something in her blood: She&rsquo;s a woman of doing, of creativity, and you almost want to be infected by it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Although Altschuler has served as president since she founded Krembo Wings, she&rsquo;s been gradually handing the reins over to others, and is in the process of stepping down as president. She made that decision wanting to avoid &ldquo;founder&rsquo;s syndrome,&rdquo; in which an organization or company revolves too tightly around its creator. She is also spending more of her non-Google time guiding the Holocaust project she founded just over three years ago. Altschuler realized then that she, like many other young Israelis, had increasingly felt emotionally disconnected from Israel&rsquo;s Holocaust Remembrance Day. She was unenthusiastic about the country&#8217;s ways of marking the day with a big national ceremony, stopping for two minutes of silence and watching Holocaust documentaries on television. She sent out an e-mail to eight friends saying she wanted to do something different, and would be inviting a concentration camp survivor to her house. Fifty people showed up, most of them crashers she&rsquo;d never seen before. Once the camp survivor, a woman named Hana Grofit, had told her story and left Altschuler&#8217;s family home in Hod HaSharon, the group began discussing what they had heard. &ldquo;It was very intimate and inspiring,&rdquo; Altschuler recalls.<\/p>\n<p>The reaction to what she initiated on that night in 2011 was so strong that who&rsquo;d attended called to ask for more, adding that they knew others who wanted to join. It&rsquo;s now called Zicharon B&rsquo;Salon (or &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.memoriesathome.org\">Memories@Home<\/a>&rdquo;) and on this year&#8217;s Holocaust Remembrance Day there were 800 such meetings in Israel and in other countries, with some members of the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, hosting meetings in their own homes.<\/p>\n<p>Lior Reichart, 28, was at that original meeting and was encouraged by Altschuler to be one of the organizers of future events. &ldquo;I feel that most Israelis don&#8217;t understand how much the Holocaust is a significant part of our personalities and how it affects the political discussion in Israel,&rdquo; Reichart explains. &ldquo;The narrative is usually really narrow on this day: We see lots of ceremonies, but there&rsquo;s no real conversation or debate about how it affects us today.&#8221; With Memories@Home, he says, that&rsquo;s beginning to change.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Adi knows how to recognize a vacuum,&rdquo; says Reichart, who recently graduated from law school. &ldquo;Secondly, she knows how to push it forward and recruit people, to take people with her, to take it a step beyond. Those two qualities &ndash; of course there are many more &ndash; are what make Adi who she is.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Altschuler is often asked if she&rsquo;ll go into politics. &ldquo;Never say never,&rdquo; is her answer, though she turned down several invitations to join various parties during the last national vote. She leans towards founding her own school &ndash; or school system. She says she might want to be a rabbi someday, though she considers herself a secular if spiritual person. She&#8217;s trying to decide what her next big challenge will be.<b> <\/b>For now, she&rsquo;s pleased with helping other social entrepreneurs launch <em>their<\/em> dreams. Her advice: don&rsquo;t ask anyone for permission, and don&rsquo;t try to go it alone. We&#8217;re all connected now, more than ever &ndash; and we&#8217;re stronger for it.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

am","short":"9\/12","hide_date":false},"content":"<p><strong>How did your relationship with Kfir Kobi, the boy with cerebral palsy you volunteered to spend time with when you yourself were quite young, develop into a realization that this could be something bigger? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I started to volunteer with Kfir when I was 12, and he was just a three-year-old boy. He made me realize that there is no such thing as disability and that we all have disabilities. His parents looked at him as if he was 100% perfect and that&rsquo;s the way he looked at himself. During the years I saw that his biggest strength was his social abilities and his sense of humor, but the opportunities for children and youth with special needs were different from &ldquo;normal kids,&rdquo; so the opportunity to experience simple childhood is very different. During the years of growing up next to him it&rsquo;s something that really bothered me. Through him I met a lot of kids and I saw that they don&rsquo;t have this kind of environment that allows them to be like every kid, to play. When I was 16 I joined a leadership development program called LEAD, and they asked me to think of something that bothered me. I knew that the thing that bothered me most was the lack of opportunities for these kids to experience a simple childhood and contribute to society.<\/p>\n<p>Kfir was like a brother to me; we were friends. I didn&rsquo;t see myself like a volunteer coming to help the poor, disabled kid. I saw myself like a big sister. I decided to duplicate the model of Kfir and Adi &ndash; the personal &ndash; to a group. We started with one branch and after a year and a half, we had four branches with 100 kids. And today, Krembo Wings operates 35 branches with 3,000 teenagers all around the country.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;re now stepping down from your role president of Krembo Wings. Why are you now handing it over to others to run it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The decision of bringing in other people to run it started in 2008. I felt that the organization needs other people with different skills to take it to the next level. I flew to India to travel for a year by myself, and then we had other people to operate the organization. When I was in India, Kfir passed away. In 2009, at the memorial ceremony for Kfir, I went to visit his grave, and while I was walking to the cemetery I got a phone call from the President&rsquo;s House, from Shimon Peres&rsquo; staff, and they said, &#8220;Hi Adi, we&rsquo;re really happy to tell you won the award for social change.&#8221; And then the next sentence was, &#8220;Krembo Wings is receiving this award.&#8221; At that point I knew we&rsquo;re doing something good because it&rsquo;s not about me anymore, it&rsquo;s about the organization. And in the past few years, the management and the people who joined the organization took it to the next level. It&rsquo;s almost a year now that I took a step back and now I&rsquo;m letting go totally &ndash; it&rsquo;s difficult but it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you relationship with Kfir impact you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kfir was my greatest teacher. I loved him and he loved me. He taught me so many things. To believe in myself, to dream, to accept my own disabilities, to go beyond them. To me it&rsquo;s like he still exists. I see a little of him in every teenager and child I meet. I still miss him. I think I was really lucky to meet him and to meet his family. His mother, Claudia, is one of the people who influenced me the most. She&rsquo;s one of the most creative people I ever met. She always found ways for him to be a part of things. [I learned] to meet someone and see beyond the wheelchair, because we all have wheelchairs. The point is to see what you can learn from the people you meet. Anyone, everywhere can be your teacher &hellip;so it&rsquo;s like a sixth sense of seeing what people <em>can<\/em> do rather than what they can&rsquo;t, because what they can&rsquo;t they already know.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More recently, you founded Memories@Home. How did that come about?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Holocaust Remembrance Day is pretty big in Israel and the memory of the Holocaust is something that influences our daily lives. A few years ago, when the Holocaust Memorial Day arrived, I felt very disconnected. You know, I know all the stories, my husband&rsquo;s grandparents are Holocaust survivors, but it felt so far away &ndash; that the day doesn&rsquo;t fulfill the potential of what I can take out of this. Usually go somewhere to a big ceremony, you sit in the audience, and you just listen. But I felt, in order to connect, I need to be engaged. I started to imagine that maybe we should do something different. Maybe we should make it a day we can connect to universal and Jewish values, to connect this lesson to being better people. So I emailed eight friends to tell them what I was thinking &ndash; and 50 people came to my house, people I didn&rsquo;t know.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You invited a Holocaust survivor to talk to the group. What happened afterwards?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We started to ask ourselves hard questions. Do we have an obligation to act differently today because our people went through a Holocaust? Where is this day going to be 10 years from now? How do we accept other people? And then I got lots of phone calls after this evening, saying, &#8220;Listen, it was one of the most influential, meaningful days I&rsquo;ve had in my life.&#8221; I started to look in the mirror and see places where I victimize others. A few friends joined to ask the same questions. This year we had 800 houses that hosted thousands of people for Memories@Home. I got phone calls from Holocaust survivors who said for the first time in my life, I&rsquo;m not passive, I&rsquo;m proactive, people embrace me and want to hear me and my story and they really want to hear about the things that happened, in order to be better people today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to take a position at Google?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two-a-half years ago, I went to look for my next thing. I knew that it doesn&rsquo;t matter where I am, I will go for education because it is an amazing instrument to empower people. I heard they were working on education in Israel. When I came, they told me, we care about education in Israel, we have the innovation and technology, we really want to narrow the gap between students and teachers, we want to help transform the education system so it will fit the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century. I was really excited about that. To date we trained 35,000 teachers around the country &ndash; innovation, pedagogy, and new ways of teaching and integrating technology in class to make learning magical again. It&rsquo;s pretty amazing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When you meet someone who wants to start an organisation oriented towards social activism, what do you tell them?<\/strong><br \/>\nIt&rsquo;s really simple. First of all, maybe it will sound clich&eacute;d, but the key is really to imagine. To think of reality as it is right now and to picture the world as if it were different. What is the change you want to see? And then, not to ask for permission. It&rsquo;s like bungee-jumping &ndash; you just need to jump. If you have a clear vision for your mission and you&rsquo;re not asking permission and you&rsquo;re just going without being scared to fail. And to remember, there&rsquo;s nothing you can do in this world alone if you want to create a change. You need to take the problem that keeps you from sleeping at night, and to have a clear vision of where to go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have lots of dreams. I have a small notebook and in it every morning I write down my dreams. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll be five years from now, but I know that I&rsquo;ll be in the field. To really touch people&rsquo;s lives and to help them transform, you need to be in the field. My biggest dream since I was really young is to be a rabbi, but not in the religious aspect. In Judaism, like other religions, you have a lot of amazing tools and values you can use to transform lives. Maybe I can use religion and Jewish values and maybe values from other religions to help people transform their lives. I dream of establishing a school &ndash; maybe a new school system &ndash; that will be a bit like Krembo Wings, in the inclusivity aspect. I think I will build a community, like maybe a new city, a new place that will be based on people&rsquo;s skills and passions, and through that we&rsquo;ll build projects for society. I think as long as I&rsquo;ll be connected to this deep place that cannot sit, cannot hold still, and just really needs to see change, to go after my dreams, I&rsquo;ll be okay.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash; <em>interview<\/em> <em>by Ilene Prusher.

a rapid reverse U-turn on a street in the Nigerian city of Lagos. &ldquo;A call just came in for an emergency in [the northern Nigerian city] Kaduna,&rdquo; says the 28-year-old trauma doctor. &ldquo;We need to load the jet for a medevac.&rdquo; With that, she speeds off toward the airport.<\/p>\n<p>Quick reaction times are fundamental to Orekunrin&rsquo;s work. The young British-Nigerian doctor is the founder and managing director of Flying Doctors Nigeria Ltd., a Lagos-based emergency air ambulance service, the first in the country.<\/p>\n<p>In Nigeria, where road and telecommunication infrastructure can be poor, and rural clinics are often unprepared to deal with emergencies, Flying Doctors has become an essential service, airlifting patients from remote areas to hospitals, and providing care en route. It has helped hundreds of patients, particularly employees in the country&rsquo;s oil and gas sector, who are among Flying Doctors&rsquo; top clients. (The for-profit company&rsquo;s client list also includes governments across West Africa, wealthy individuals and corporations.)<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p>London-born Orekunrin was inspired to launch the company in the aftermath of a tragedy that struck her family while she was in medical school in Britain. Her 12-year-old sister was on holiday in Nigeria and unexpectedly needed emergency treatment. The nearest clinic wasn&rsquo;t able to treat her. The family scrambled to find an air ambulance to move her to an appropriate facility, but the quickest available service was several away in South Africa. Her sister had died by the time it was available.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There was a real sense of grief and almost anger,&rdquo; Orekunrin recalls of her sister&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;I wanted to come [to Nigeria] and try to contribute in some way or form to the emergency services here.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It was a daunting task for a number of reasons. In Nigeria there are only four doctors per 10,000 citizens, compared with 25 doctors per 10,000 in the United States. After studying other models of emergency air ambulances in the U.K. and other parts of Africa, Orekunrin knew it would be the most effective way to help patients access the proper facilities in an expansive region that is often difficult to travel by car.<\/p>\n<p>But getting Flying Doctors off the ground wasn&rsquo;t easy. Nigeria is notoriously bureaucratic, ranking 147 out of 189 countries on the World Bank&rsquo;s ease of doing business index. Orekunrin was met with layers of red tape.<\/p>\n<p>She turned to Segun Demuren, a Nigerian aviation entrepreneur, for advice. He was impressed with her ideas, as well as her drive. &ldquo;Her motivation was personal,&rdquo; says Demuren, who is currently a Flying Doctors client. &ldquo;It allows you to think outside the box and forces you to think of what is possible.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Orekunrin began by leasing aircraft as a way to keep costs down. (Orekunrin declined to comment on how her business is funded.) She then established partnerships with hospitals across Africa and abroad and launched Flying Doctors Nigeria, nearly five years ago. The company now operates a fleet of 20 helicopters and jets and a staff that includes seven senior flight physicians.<\/p>\n<p>On the back of her success with private clients Orekunrin has also worked toward improving medical care across Nigeria. Flying Doctors now provides scholarships to medical students and has established partnerships with rural non-governmental organizations, such as the Starlite Hopes Initiative, in Nigeria&rsquo;s Delta state, which offers care to the poor.<\/p>\n<p>She&rsquo;s also concerned with improving access for air evacuations in dangerous regions, such as Borno State, home to Islamist militants Boko Haram. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d have to be lots of security,&rdquo; she says of such missions, which are impossible at the moment. &ldquo;And the way we land would also have to change. You can&rsquo;t do a typical landing where you start your descent early because there&rsquo;s a risk of anti-aircraft fire.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Orekunrin hopes to keep finding new ways to improve medical services in Nigeria. The young doctor knows there are challenges ahead, but as she&rsquo;s already shown, not even the sky is the limit.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\"

here in Nigeria, because she couldn&rsquo;t access an emergency service.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There wasn&rsquo;t an air ambulance service in Nigeria when you started out. How did you know where to start?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think if you look across the developing world as a whole there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunities from the West that can sort of be hacked and brought to Africa &ndash; sometimes even in an improved form.<\/p>\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"expand-article\">+ Read More<\/a><div class=\"expand-article-content\">\n<p><strong>Who are your typical patients?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are private patients and they usually come from corporations or insurance companies, and that&rsquo;s across West Africa. There&rsquo;s also the government [contracts]. So sometimes if there&rsquo;s a disaster &ndash; some sort of road disaster, or a terrorist disaster &ndash; then the government here or in another country will tell us to come in and evacuate the patients to better hospitals. [We partner] with NGOs as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You now run a team of seven senior physicians as well as support staff. Do you have time to be on deck these days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I try and do a bit of both the clinical and the management. A lot of our patients are very sick and require a very specialist skill set. We usually work in two or three doctor crews.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happens when you get a call?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It depends. Sometimes [the patient will] just be brought in to Lagos. If they&rsquo;re being flown in from quite a remote part of Nigeria then Lagos and Abuja are usually their destinations. We [also] get patients flown in from Mali, from Chad, from Niger, into Nigeria for treatment.<\/p>\n<p>And then obviously the whole of the offshore industry relies on helicopter air ambulances also to bring people who have been injured, or [fallen] ill offshore, onto the shore for treatment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So you could pick someone up from Kaduna, in northern Nigeria, now and fly him or her to London in a few hours?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. There&rsquo;s a huge British expatriate community here and we fly them to London if they need it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have you ever had a patient whose injuries stayed with you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you speak to any of our doctors they&rsquo;ll all give you a different story. [For me] there was an injury [caused by Islamist militant group Boko Haram] where the gentleman had been shot in the face and most of his face was gone<em>. <\/em>He actually ended up having to be flown to London for reconstructive surgery. Looking at a human being who had most of his face gone was definitely something that stayed with me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happened to him?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Half of his face was actually removed by the bullet. That stayed with me because he was supposed to get married the next week. It was really, really heart-rending &ndash; his main concern was for his wife-to-be not to see him in that state. And I was so glad when I saw what [the surgeons] had done; it was a complete transformation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Did the marriage go ahead in the end?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He did get married in the end.<\/p>\n<p><em><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&mdash; interview by Monica Mark.
