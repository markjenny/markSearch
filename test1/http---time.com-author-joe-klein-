	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">He's a long shot, but could give Hillary heartburn</h2>
    <p>With all the impact of a sparrow&#8217;s feather landing in the forest, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb announced the formation of a 2016 presidential exploratory committee last night. He did it in a video and letter sent to supporters. He thus becomes the first official challenger to Hillary Clinton, who has not yet gone exploratory, on the Democratic side.</p>
<p>Webb is interesting. He is not your standard-issue politician. He is a decorated former Marine, perhaps the best war novelist of the Vietnam generation, Secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan. His one term in the Senate was protean, with Webb focusing on issues as diverse as the reestablishment of relations with Burma, and prison reform, and the new GI bill for Iraq-Afghanistan veterans.</p>
<p>He will be a refreshing presence on the campaign trail. He doesn&#8217;t talk like a politician. He can be blunt and combative. He has taken strong populist economic stands and was a strong opponent of the war in Iraq. In fact, Webb goes in strong whenever he takes a stand. He&#8217;ll certainly be fun to watch during debates (he was a boxer at Annapolis).</p>
<p>You&#8217;d have to call him a longshot, of course. But I suspect he&#8217;ll be one of those long shots who have the power to shape a campaign with new ideas and sharp arguments. He will certainly cause Clinton some populist agita, should she run.</p>

Mike didn&rsquo;t know that I had written it &mdash; I was still anonymous &mdash; and I&rsquo;d never met him, but I felt safe. He wouldn&rsquo;t turn the satire into burlesque. He would treat the characters with respect.</p>
<p>The project turned out to be something of a disappointment for him. A good part of the book&rsquo;s sexiness was wrapped in the mystery of the author&rsquo;s identity, and when I was outed, the mystery was solved. But Mike gave it all the charm and intelligence he could muster, which was limitless. One day on the set, he and Emma Thompson &mdash; another class act &mdash; started talking about how various stage actors apply their talents to the art of the bow. Within minutes, they were demonstrating. They took turns, hilariously, tiptoeing and dashing onto the stage, bold and shy, tearful and arrogant and brilliant. <em>You love me? I&rsquo;m so flattered. Amazed. Shocked. Well, of course, you love me. You damn well better love me, after what I just did for you. (I&rsquo;m touched that you love me, anyway.)</em></p>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s world was like that. The observations were always acute, the intelligence was there to delight, not to dominate. He was relentlessly gracious, clever and generous. There was no pretense or edge to him. We took several long plane trips together, with our wives. He was incredibly generous, bringing us along for the ride when <em>Primary Colors</em> was chosen to open the Cannes Film Festival. The conversation was as good as it gets, not just showbiz stories, but serious ramblings about books and theater and psychology, and the inherent awkwardness of journalism. And wordplay, sly and delectable, always. There was a benign magic to his presence; even when the plane landed, our feet hardly touched the ground.</p>

    <aside class="right-rail-module rr-outbrain" data-name="rr-outbrain"><div class="OUTBRAIN" data-src="http://time.com/3596973/tackling-immigration-alone/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside><p>Can the president of the United States, wielding a magic pen, simply exempt approximately 5 million illegal immigrants from the threat of deportation? You bet he can. He has the power to set law-enforcement priorities. In 2012, Barack Obama ordered that children brought across the border by their parents and raised in the U.S.&#8211;the so-called Dream Generation&#8211;should not be targeted for deportation. He can expand that ruling to their parents and others. Both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush took similar actions on a smaller scale. The question is, why on earth would the President want to do it now, after the disastrous election of 2014? Newly minted Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said it would be like &#8220;waving a red flag in front of a bull,&#8221; which may have been more artful than literal. McConnell also said that he wouldn&#8217;t shut down the government (nor will the Republican leadership move toward impeachment). The President may have simply calculated that signing his executive actions would be more like waving a tissue in front of a goat.</p>
<p>It is not impossible that Obama is playing some hard-nosed politics here, even if his primary motivation is soft-nosed and idealistic. It is simple humanitarian justice not to separate families by deporting the parents of the Dream Generation. If John Boehner had brought last year&#8217;s bipartisan Senate immigration bill to a vote in the House, the situation might have been happily resolved. &#8220;But it&#8217;s like waiting for a bus that never comes,&#8221; says David Axelrod, a former Obama aide. The Republican definition of immigration reform is unacceptable to most Democrats. It consists of more money for border security and a fast track for skilled foreigners who want to immigrate; it does not include a path to legality for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here. Obama no doubt calculated that negotiations with the GOP on this issue were futile. On top of that, the President may not be too pleased with the members of his inner circle who told him to delay his executive actions last summer for &#8220;political&#8221; reasons, as he so awkwardly put it&#8211;that is, to save some Democratic Senate candidates who ultimately could not be saved. This President does not like to come off as tawdry or political. A quick executive move now is a way to rectify the games he&#8217;s played with Latinos.</p>
<p>But it also may be effective politics. In the long term, every time the Republicans start screaming and stomping about illegal Mexicans, it cements the Latino relationship with the Democratic Party, a demographic boon. There will certainly be a lot of screaming when Obama goes ahead with his plan&#8211;and then we will celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas, a traditionally fallow political period, and the immigration issue will be ancient history by the time McConnell convenes his Republican-majority Senate in January. Hence, another calculation: Despite the immigration order, the Republicans will still want to do business with the President. They will want to demonstrate that gridlock was all Harry Reid&#8217;s fault. The Republican Senators up for re-election in 2016 will need some bacon to bring home. There are trade bills that Republicans will certainly want to pass, and infrastructure bills, and perhaps even some tax reform. Obama will share the credit for those middling triumphs, and he&#8217;ll seem tough besides, having blasted through the &#8220;red flag&#8221; and gotten stuff done.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3596973"></div>
<div class="video-wrapper" data-pos="2" data-continuous="1"><object id="bc-video-3899864728001-2" class="BrightcoveExperience"><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"><param name="width" value="100%"><param name="height" value="100%"><param name="playerID" value="1847503743001"><param name="isVid" value="true"><param name="isUI" value="true"><param name="dynamicStreaming" value="true"><param name="videoSmoothing" value="true"><param name="autoStart" value="false"><param name="linkBaseURL" value="http://wp.me/p5HMd-f5JH"><param name="includeAPI" value="true"><param name="templateLoadHandler" value="TIME_onTemplateLoad"><param name="templateReadyHandler" value="TIME_onTemplateReady"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="htmlFallback" value="true"><param name="@videoPlayer" value="3899864728001"></object></div>
<p>But there will be consequences. By moving ahead with the immigration plan, Obama sacrifices any leeway he might have had with Republicans on a range of more difficult issues. He was going to have a tough time selling an Iran nuclear deal&#8211;if there is such a deal&#8211;to Congress, but it could become impossible now. There will be all sorts of Obamacare challenges, some of which might have been avoided if the President had not pierced the illusion of comity. Democrats will argue that Obama was played for a sucker every time he anticipated the possibility of Republican compromise, and there is a lot to that. But that may well have been the last war. The coming legislative battles could be more subtle and pliable.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may be trying to goad us into doing something stupid&#8221; like shutting down the government or moving toward impeachment, says Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221; Indeed, Republicans have been talking in more surgical fiscal terms&#8211;defunding specific programs, like those that would implement the executive actions, rather than a wholesale shutdown. Worse, Obama&#8217;s immigration actions, noble as they might be, fly in the face of the national mood. At a moment when the public desperately wants some sort of reconciliation, he is sticking a finger in McConnell&#8217;s eye. After playing the reasonable grownup for the first six years of his presidency, he is giving up the high ground.</p>

He seemed to be indicating that officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted for killing the unarmed Michael Brown on Aug. 9. If so, there is likely to be a public explosion of outrage. Of course, if Wilson is cleared, there will have to be compelling evidence that his extreme action was justified. But justifiable homicide does not equal unpreventable homicide. This killing didn&#8217;t need to happen.</p>

Hicks was reluctant to talk about which specific techniques he would have used, because he wasn&#8217;t there. &#8220;I do teach weapon retainment, but that&#8217;s not the point. It&#8217;s how you carry yourself in the community you serve. You have to project calm and confidence,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;You have to be trained physically, mentally and even spiritually to make moral decisions instinctively, spur of the moment.&#8221; Wilson had placed himself on the defensive from the start. By all accounts, he was sitting in his car, talking to Brown through his open window. He needed to get out of the car and subtly establish his authority. Things like tone of voice, body language and facial expression can make all the difference.</p>

Kennedy. After the Detroit riots in 1967&#8211;43 civilians were killed and hundreds injured&#8211;Walinsky spent the next 20 years studying police practices, from the pavement up. His original thought was to create an elite program that would lure graduates from top colleges to do four years of service in return for scholarship money and a fast track to graduate school. In the end, the recruits mostly came from state colleges, and they were kids who wanted to become cops anyway. Bill Clinton was the first board chairman of the Police Corps, and his Administration funded the program in 1995.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3583137"></div>
<p>Training was the heart of the Corps. It was full-time residential, a form of boot camp. It was far more physical than routine training&#8211;the graduates were superfit&#8211;but the mental conditioning was rigorous as well. Indeed, it very much resembled the training the military provides for special operators like SEALs and Green Berets. It was situational: actors and retired cops were hired to play miscreants, and recruits were judged on how well they responded to spur-of-the-moment situations. Even the firing range was situational: it was paintball, and you could easily be &#8220;shot&#8221; if you made the wrong call. There was required reading about urban poverty, police work and leadership. Recruits were required to mentor troubled boys and girls. And Hicks taught them how to be: how to use their hands, how to present themselves, how to protect themselves. &#8220;I can pick out the Police Corps graduates on the street just by the way they stand,&#8221; said Baltimore police chief Ed Norris, who was one of the first to embrace the Corps. In the end, Walinsky produced more than 1,000 of the best-trained police officers in the country, and many are still on the job.</p>
<p>The Police Corps was tiny and expensive. There was all sorts of opposition to it. Liberals preferred that the money be spent on antipoverty programs. Conservatives liked the idea but preferred that the money not be spent at all. It was killed by George W. Bush, at which point federal spending on police programs went entirely in the wrong direction by providing local cops with militarized up-armored vehicles, cammies, Kevlar, sniper rifles. This, at a moment when the military, especially the Army, was moving toward retraining its troops in a way that resembled the Police Corps. &#8220;We want them to be able to make moral decisions under pressure on the basis of incomplete information,&#8221; General David Petraeus once told me, using almost the same words as Hicks.</p>
<p>The public conversation since the death of Michael Brown has largely been a waste of time. Remonstrating about race is important, but wouldn&#8217;t it be more useful to talk about training&#8211;not just for police officers, but teachers too? Good training costs money, but we need to have a conversation about how we currently spend money. These are the people, after all, who shape our lives and sometimes, tragically, our deaths.</p>

The first speaker was Ray Buckley, chairman of the state party. Every other speaker, and there were lots, was a woman. There were two female candidates for state senate from the Nashua area. There was one of New Hampshire&#8217;s two (out of two) female members of Congress. There was Maggie Hassan, the incumbent governor. There was Jeanne Shaheen, a former governor locked in a tight race for another term in the U.S. Senate. Hillary Clinton was there too&#8211;at the last rally of 45 campaign stops she made for Democratic candidates during the 2014 campaign.</p>

No doubt, the Republican sweep can be attributed to the unloved Obama, and to the fact that Presidents usually fare badly in their sixth-year election, and to the states in play, which favored the Republicans. But the Democratic candidates were weak and inept; they seemed defensive, reflexive, played out. They pretty much limited themselves to women&#8217;s issues, and those were clearly not enough to convince a frightened and frustrated country.</p>
<p>I watched Clinton speak three times during the campaign, and she limited herself to women&#8217;s issues too, but she did it cleverly. The emphasis was on economics rather than reproductive rights. She was especially good on the economic impact of pay equity: working women would have more money to spend, and they would spend it on consumer goods, which would create jobs&#8211;the opposite of trickle-down economics. She told specific personal stories about her difficulties as a working mom. She spoke slowly, softly, far more confidently than she had in past campaigns. There was a two-tiered rationale for her message: she was spot-on the Democrats&#8217; national pitch, a good soldier selling the blue brand, but the emphasis on women&#8217;s rights also redressed a failing from her 2008 campaign. She had run on &#8220;experience&#8221; then and downplayed the fact that she was a piece of history: the first plausible woman to run for President. She doesn&#8217;t have to worry about experience now; everyone knows she has it. The question is, how does she play to her strengths as a woman if she chooses to run? (And I assume she will.) And how does she convince voters that she&#8217;s not the same old, same old?</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3560468"></div>
<p>The 2014 exit polls indicated that both political parties are roundly disdained. The Republicans earned their enmity because of their angry, intransigent extremism, but they may be emerging from the swamp. Their candidates this year were more moderate (though they still pandered shamelessly to the party&#8217;s paranoid base). Even Mitch McConnell was making postelection noises about getting stuff done in Washington. This raises a potential problem for Democrats. It could put a crimp in one of their strongest arguments: We&#8217;re not Republicans.</p>
<p>There are two even larger, perhaps existential problems for the Dems. They are the party of government, and people don&#8217;t like government. They don&#8217;t think it works. The botched rollout of Obamacare is far more persuasive to many people than its ensuing successes. Additionally, Democrats have allowed themselves to be lulled by demographics. They are strong among growing blocs: women, young people, minorities. Consequently, they have come to seem a party of identities rather than issues. They don&#8217;t speak to a larger, unifying sense of America; they speak to women and try to get out the vote among blacks, Latinos and students. They have come to seem opportunistic rather than optimistic.</p>
<p>The Obama Presidency is crippled, not dead. There will be opportunities for compromise and even triumph. But the Democrats are now Hillary Clinton&#8217;s party. She will be challenged for the nomination, and she will have to adjust to new political realities. She will also have to figure out a way to seem fresh, aggressive and optimistic&#8211;the precise opposite of the candidates the Democrats put forward in 2014.</p>

He stands in contrast to Greg Orman, an independent running for Senate in Kansas, who refuses to tell voters whether he&#8217;d caucus as a Republican or a Democrat&#8211;no small thing, since his first vote may determine which party controls the Senate. This has been a craven, silly campaign on all sides. It has been a boom year for incompetent candidates, accompanied by the long-term decline of those with anything interesting to say. The advertising was, as always, atrocious, but it seemed more influential than ever because of the prevailing vacuity. Important issues were raised, but there was precious little actual discussion of them. Republicans wanted to talk about the perils of illegal immigration, but Democrats, by and large, refused to make the strong moral and practical argument in favor of reform&#8211;an argument embodied in a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate with significant Republican support. And when Democrats raised the no-brainer issue of equal pay for equal work, the Republicans simply refused to engage.</p>
<p>On a recent trip through the South, I asked several dozen politicians of both parties to name the one big thing they wanted to accomplish in Washington. They fled specificity for the safer precincts of banality&#8211;&#8221;balance the budget&#8221; for Republicans, &#8220;work across the aisle&#8221; for Democrats. No one had the courage to cite a specific idea: Here are six anachronistic weapons systems I&#8217;d like to cut; or, We should exempt small banks from the onerous Dodd-Frank regulations. They had been schooled well. You don&#8217;t want to take a specific stand on anything you don&#8217;t have to. People might not like your position. Popular democracy always bumbles toward the trivial, but the dullness of this year&#8217;s campaign has been paralytic.</p>
<p>And yet there are important matters at stake on Nov. 4&#8211;not least of which is whether Mitch McConnell&#8217;s Republicans will gain control of the Senate. A week out, it was still an open question. But even if the Republicans stumble, the results could yield some hints about the immediate future of American politics. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be looking at:</p>
<p><strong>1. Democrats And Women</strong></p>
<p>Chris Matthews once called the Democrats the &#8220;mommy&#8221; party. They were the meta-mommy party in this campaign. The heart of the matter was four female Democrats in hot Southern Senate races: Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, Michelle Nunn in Georgia and the incumbents Kay Hagan in North Carolina and Mary Landrieu in Louisiana. Each emphasized women&#8217;s issues&#8211;equal pay, parental leave, abortion rights&#8211;in the hope of luring undecided, independent women to the fold. This has been page 1 in the Democratic playbook for at least 40 years. (Page 2 is scaring people about the loss of old-age entitlements.) It has been effective and still may be&#8211;but it has never before carried the electoral burden that it does this year. The alleged toxicity of Barack Obama has made it unsafe for Democrats to discuss much else.</p>
<p>The party was boosted by the failed Bush wars in 2006, 2008 and 2012, but Democrats have been boggled by what to say about ISIS in 2014. They&#8217;ve had no significant new ideas, foreign or domestic, on offer. And they&#8217;ve been too afraid to tout Obama&#8217;s complicated successes&#8211;the stimulus package that prevented a depression, the health care plan that may actually be working, and relative order at the border (a result of many years of security enhancements and a diminished flow of illegals during recent rough economic times). The argument on women&#8217;s economic issues is strong. It remains to be seen whether baby boomers who boast remarkable three-month, 3-D sonograms of their grandchildren will be quite so militant about abortion rights in the future. The fate of women&#8217;s issues, in the South and elsewhere, will have an impact on whether the party has to start rethinking its message going forward. It may not be able to count on Republicans&#8217; continuing their boorish ways. Unless, of course, the conservatives win and overread the results this year.</p>

<p><strong>2. Republicans And Purple States</strong></p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3547829"></div>
<p>Iowa and New Hampshire are mythic presidential-primary states; Colorado is a crucial, purple general-election state. All three have been trending toward the Democrats in recent campaigns. All three are senatorial toss-ups this year. In Iowa, the Republicans are boosted by an energetic candidate, Joni Ernst, facing a dreadful Democrat, Bruce Braley&#8211;who opened the campaign with a lawyerly slur against Chuck Grassley, the other U.S. Senator from Iowa. Grassley isn&#8217;t a lawyer&#8211;he&#8217;s well known and beloved as an Iowa farmer&#8211;and he&#8217;ll chair the Judiciary Committee if the Republicans win the Senate. This would be a big problem, Braley warned, as if lawyers weren&#8217;t considered more toxic than farmers by most Iowa voters. But there&#8217;s no excuse for the tight races that estimable Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Mark Udall find themselves struggling through in New Hampshire and Colorado. Actually, there&#8217;s one excuse: Obama. He has been the Republicans&#8217; one and only issue across the country, and it might well work. But what if it doesn&#8217;t? What if Obama&#8211;like women&#8217;s issues for the Democrats&#8211;is being overplayed?</p>
<p>This goes to the question of the Republicans&#8217; strategy if they do win the Senate. Will they decide to make the Oval Office a veto factory by passing conservative wish-list bills, like repealing Obamacare, and sending them on to the White House? Or will they seek deals on immigration, infrastructure improvement and maybe even health care? Recent history suggests continued warfare. But that supposes that all of the American people despise the President as much as the Republican base does. The past six years have been a juvenile, name-calling fiesta for the likes of Rush Limbaugh, who prospers when Republicans are out of power. It is very tempting for the party to stay that course. I wouldn&#8217;t bet against it. But Republicans found in 1998 that compromising with a Democratic President could produce odd results, like balanced budgets and a Republican presidential victory in 2000.</p>
<p><strong>3. Kansas Rejoins The Mainstream</strong></p>
<p>The Senate race between the aforementioned independent, Greg Orman, and Republican stalwart Pat Roberts is curious. But the plight of the current governor, Sam Brownback, may be historic. Brownback has pitched his tent atop the quicksand of voodoo economics. The results are the same as when Ronald Reagan tried massive tax cuts in 1981: they have blown a giant hole in tax revenue. Unsustainable budget cuts&#8211;in education, in everything&#8211;have resulted. Brownback points out that the economy eventually revived under Reagan. True enough, but only after Reagan agreed to several huge tax increases and the tight-money magic of Paul Volcker&#8217;s Federal Reserve wrung inflation out of the system. Brownback&#8217;s Kansas disaster has caused the local Chamber of Commerce to rise up and support his Democratic opponent, Paul Davis, and this may have long-term consequences for Republicans.</p>
<p>The Chamber and other business groups have always opposed higher taxes and tighter regulations; their tacit support helped launch the Tea Party. But what if business groups, large and small, decide that fiscal responsibility is more important than tax cuts? Traditionally, business has also supported spending on education and infrastructure. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the high-tech community support immigration reform. What if the national business community follows the Kansas example and reshuffles its priorities? The Republican Party may well have to reshuffle its priorities too, and the myth of extreme supply-side economics might finally be put to rest.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Quiet Jungle</strong></p>
<p>Last spring I wrote about the new electoral possibilities in California, given its system of open primaries&#8211;also called jungle primaries. This allows the two top vote getters in the primary to compete in the general election, regardless of party. The aim was to rouse more centrist candidates. The mammoth 53-seat California congressional delegation has yielded only two same-party finals in 2014. In District 17, a moderate Democrat named Ro Khanna is challenging the traditional Democratic incumbent Mike Honda; in District 4, the Tea Party incumbent Tom McClintock is facing a more moderate Republican challenger, a West Point graduate named Art Moore. If the moderates win, it may encourage other centrists to try next time. But the incumbents seem to have a slight edge in both races.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Omniscient Pollster</strong></p>
<p>In 2012, Nate Silver of the FiveThirtyEight website correctly predicted the presidential results in every state. Consequently&#8211;and since the politicians aren&#8217;t having very many rallies anymore&#8211;the press has paid even more than its usual excessive attention to polling in the 2014 campaign. Very elaborate compilations by different sources have given the Republicans a monumental advantage in taking the Senate this year. But there&#8217;s a problem: the Republicans don&#8217;t have a monumental advantage in any of the key toss-up states. The polling has most of those races within the margin of error. And polling on down-ballot races is notoriously less accurate than it is on the presidential level. I won&#8217;t be surprised if the Republicans win the election, but it is possible they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It may be too much to ask that we journalists stop trying to do what we do worst&#8211;predicting the outcomes of races&#8211;and start doing what we should do best: hounding the candidates into specific answers on difficult questions. My sense this year has been that most politicians now assume that the vexing need to deal with journalists is pretty much over, unless they commit a mouth misdemeanor or something unseemly emerges about their past. They may be right. The media aren&#8217;t as powerful as they used to be. Budgets are tighter. There aren&#8217;t as many Walter Robinsons around to unearth the last thing that the public has come to expect: the shocking positive story.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3547829"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

There must be some significance in that, right? Uh, no. Their appearances were complementary, not competitive. We tend to overanalyze these things at times&#8230; but it was fun to compare and contrast, all the same, as both women worked to gin up support for Martha Coakley, the Democratic candidate in the Massachusetts Governor race, as she seemed to slip behind her Republican opponent Charles Baker.</p>

She actually shook her fist at one point, but this was not a pitchfork speech&#8230; and not a long one, either. I&#8217;ve always been impressed by Warren&#8217;s ability to explain the complexities of financial policy in a way that civilians can understand, but she didn&#8217;t have much time for that. She stuck to the job at hand: praising Coakley as a populist hero. And she did it very well, if not transcendently.</p>
<p>Clinton was obviously the star of the show. She spoke <em>after</em> Coakley, and was given much more time than Warren. She was greeted, as both Warren and Coakley were, by a roar, though her roar may have been a smidgeon louder than the others&#8217;. She wasted no time in praising Warren as someone willing to &#8220;give it to those who deserve to get it.&#8221; (She also praised all the other elected officials present, especially Coakley.)</p>
<p>It will be said that Warren emphasized her break-up-the-banks populism while Clinton spoke about women&#8217;s issues, and that is true&#8211;although Clinton did offer one passing acknowledgment of Coakley as someone who was willing to fight against &#8220;corrupt financial institutions&#8221; during her years as Mass. Atty. General. But that wasn&#8217;t the most important thing about her speech. Actually, there were three important things:</p>
<p>1. The emphasis on women&#8217;s rights, especially equal pay, was spot on the Democrats&#8217; most successful message in these 2014 campaigns. She told a personal story about Chelsea getting sick at the age of two, on a day when Clinton had to appear in court as a young lawyer. She told it well, making clear her anguish throughout the day, the difficulty of finding someone to take care of Chelsea (finally, &#8220;a trusted friend&#8221; volunteered to help) and the relief when she got home to find Chelsea better and reading with the friend. This was the opposite of her awkward &#8220;poor&#8221;-mouthing during her book tour. It was recognizably life-sized and very effective.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3537802"></div>
<p>2. The story was striking to old-timers like me because this was exactly the sort of message she rarely delivered when she ran for President in 2008. She took the advice of her pollster-strategist Mark Penn and emphasized her experience rather than her gender, which was disastrously stupid. Her life-long obsession with women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s issues is a calling more than a message. Although, a message it certainly is, grounded and practical&#8230;and she laid out the financial benefits of equal pay in a way that might have made the Big Dog proud: she talked about the things that moms could buy with the extra money. Food for the kids, better daycare, maybe even a car&#8211;think about the impact on the economy! (Actually, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if her husband had helped a little with that one.)</p>
<p>3. She spoke slowly, confidently, conversationally. No screaming. The audience listened intently, at times losing track of what they were supposed to do for applause lines. She didn&#8217;t try to rouse them, except at the end&#8211;when her peroration began inaudible because of the cheers.</p>
<p>Yes, it was packaged. Almost everything is, in politics these days. But it didn&#8217;t <em>seem</em> packaged. There&#8217;s a long and winding road to travel between now and 2016, but she seems to have given smarter and subtler thought to how she&#8217;s going to present herself than she did last time.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3537802"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

He said, and I quote, &#8220;Ahhh-uhhhhhhhhhm,&#8221; followed by two minutes of gobbledygook. Two days later, Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senator from Kentucky, was asked who she voted for in 2008 and 2012. Her answer was similarly excruciating, and foolish. She cited the privacy of the ballot box. And about the same time, former-nearly-everything Leon Panetta landed a hammer blow on his old boss: &#8220;He [Obama] approaches things like a law professor in presenting a logic of his position &#8230; My experience in Washington is that logic alone doesn&#8217;t work. Once you lay out a position, you are going to roll up your sleeves and you have to fight to get it done &#8230; In order for Presidents to succeed, they cannot just&#8211;when they run into problems&#8211;step back and give up.&#8221;</p>

This is the part where I&#8217;m supposed to defend the President. He really did pull us out of a probable depression with an effective stimulus package; the economy continues to wheeze, but it wheezes forward. He really did make history by producing a universal health care plan that will not be repealed but will be reformed over time. The nonstop Republican critique that these programs were &#8220;disasters&#8221; has been rendered ridiculous. (In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell had to pull a Mark Pryor on that state&#8217;s very successful version of Obama&#8217;s plan.) The President has been sane and relatively moderate in his selection of Supreme Court Justices. His proposed job-growth policies would probably work, if given a chance by the Republicans.</p>
<p>He has been sane, too, in his foreign policy, for the most part. Those who say he should have been tougher on ISIS by arming the Syrian rebels&#8211;talking to you, Madam Secretary and Mr. Panetta&#8211;are wildly wrong. We would have wound up arming ISIS. There is precedent for this: we offered a fabulous buffet of armaments to the Iraqis, who left them for ISIS as they turned tail and ran in Mosul. Obama did cleave to the dreadful Nouri al-Maliki too uncritically&#8211;and thereby allowed a corrupt Shi&#8217;ite fragment to call its sectarian tune. That was Obama&#8217;s fundamental Iraq mistake.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3512660"></div>
<p>But who hasn&#8217;t made an Iraq mistake over the past decade? The proof of Obama&#8217;s moderation can be found in the blundering simplicity of his critics: the neo-imperialists who think we can actually determine, by force of arms, what happens in the Middle East; the left-libertarians who don&#8217;t think we have the right to protect ourselves from terrorism by launching drone strikes, conducting special operations and tracking terrorist phone calls. Obama has stood as a bulwark against the irrationalities of both parties.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the case for Obama. I really believe it. But I also believe that Panetta has a point. It is about the ethereal nature of true leadership. I remember writing a similar defense of Jimmy Carter nearly 40 years ago: a great number of the policies that Ronald Reagan was later given credit for launching&#8211;Paul Volcker&#8217;s tough inflation cure; a bristling stand against the Soviets, including intermediate missiles in Europe&#8211;were Carter&#8217;s policies first. He slugged his way to a historic peace treaty in the Middle East, but he didn&#8217;t convey two essential American qualities: forcefulness and optimism. Indeed, if you look at his infamous &#8220;malaise&#8221; speech, it&#8217;s a riveting piece of work, containing more tough truth about the country than the pile of Democratic utterances in the ensuing decade. I remember thinking, Poor Jimmy: history has led America to a rut, and we&#8217;ll never be as powerful as we once were. Reagan proved me young and foolish. Some of his achievements are illusory or attributable to Carter policies (as in economics), but the man knew how to lead.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that for Obama. I sense that Panetta is right about his unwillingness to fight. Lately, the President&#8217;s body language has too often conveyed disgust and cynicism. He seems defeated by the trivial pursuits of the media and his opponents. He does not have the sunny conviction necessary to carry the country through a period of near biblical plagues and wars. His policies and popularity have been crippled by his dour political sense. A basic law of politics: this cannot last. But I have no idea what comes next.</p>

Kevin and Lois Martello, a dentist and speech therapist, respectively, had put together a group of 15 friends and neighbors to talk politics, and it was pretty intense from the start. I asked Lee Foshee, who had raised the post-office question, where he&#8217;d heard that. He told me he had several sources. One of them may have been the right-wing Breitbart website, I later learned, which has been tracking ammo sales to federal agencies. Breitbart didn&#8217;t mention the price-raising strategy, but Bill Kostelka, a certified public accountant, confirmed that he&#8217;d had to stand in line to buy .22-caliber rounds recently. (For the record: the U.S. Postal Inspection Service is armed and needs ammo from time to time.)</p>

She and her husband were a bit more moderate than some of their friends. &#8220;Especially in the election season,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;when all the ads are on the air. But even on the news, it&#8217;s hard to tell what&#8217;s real.&#8221; I was tempted to defend my profession, but we seemed to be in a full-fledged American Moment, and I didn&#8217;t want to kill the buzz. Anyway, Kevin Martello, Lois&#8217; husband, tried to take the conversation &#8220;in a different direction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m pretty concerned that the top 1% of the population controls 40% of the wealth in this country.&#8221;</p>

There was more concern about government waste than about unseen wealth. Indeed, another chorus of consternation ensued, this time about food stamps. Waylon Bates, the principal of the local middle school, said he&#8217;d seen people &#8220;buying T-bone steaks and giant bottles of orange soda&#8221; with government scrip. Others said they&#8217;d seen the very same thing. And Foshee said he&#8217;d seen long lines at a combination liquor store and check-cashing place&#8211;a fine establishment, no doubt&#8211;on the day the Social Security disability checks came out each month.</p>
<p>I have heard the T-bone steak and orange-soda riff a number of times on road trips in recent years. It is always T-bone steaks. Sometimes it&#8217;s dog food too. Is it true? Maybe so; there are food-stamp abuses, no doubt. Or maybe it happened once, someone saw it, and the story spread, sprayed into the atmosphere by talk radio. It is now an urban (and rural) legend. The food-stamp stories mix with more purposeful fantasies spread by interest groups, like the National Rifle Association&#8217;s constant spew that the government wants to &#8220;take away&#8221; your guns rather than merely regulate their use. And then there are the immigrant stories: Kostelka heard about a carload of Mexicans stopped by the local police without driver&#8217;s licenses or proof of residency. &#8220;And they were given a fine and set free,&#8221; he said. True, no doubt, but incomplete: fewer would-be immigrants have been crossing the border in recent years, and the Obama Administration has been sending record numbers back home.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3483899"></div>
<p>Democrats are swimming against the prevailing cynicism as they attempt to retain the Senate this year. Across the South, their candidates are placing a heavy bet on women&#8217;s issues, especially equal pay, and education. In some places, like North Carolina, where a traditional emphasis on education spending has been violated by the Republican state legislature, they have a chance to win. In Louisiana, where Senator Mary Landrieu is facing a virtual candidate named Bill Cassidy&#8211;local reporters claim they can&#8217;t find the guy, and I couldn&#8217;t either&#8211;the incumbent is facing a real hurdle. The hurdle is Barack Obama, about whom the crazy rumors are&#8211;still!&#8211;thick, and the ads are constant: each of the incumbent Democratic Senators running in the Southern states I visited has voted with the President more than 90% of the time. That is one thing every voter who enters the polls will know next month.</p>
<p>There is also an undercurrent of fear&#8211;about ISIS and Ebola&#8211;that does not help the Democrats. Most of the people I talked with don&#8217;t think this federal government is competent to handle anything. And there is an undercurrent of exhaustion, especially among Democrats who have talked themselves silly trying to dispel the rumor fog that has engulfed political discourse. These are stories that stick in the mind and rot the body politic. They are a dominant political currency, and not just in the South.</p>

Her name was Patricia Mays and she was running for state representative&#8211;as a Republican, against a Democratic incumbent. Mays is young and attractive, and very straight ahead: She has a PhD in industrial engineering from Texas A&amp;M, and she has four issues. They are: abortion, education reform, health care and jobs. We spoke about all of them and she had some interesting ideas, especially in health care where she supports a system of local clinics where the doctors are paid directly by the patients, eliminating the insurance companies. &#8220;Then you could offer a major medical plan on top of that,&#8221; she said. (We didn&#8217;t talk about how this would be funded, but she said, correctly, that it would be a lot cheaper with the insurance companies out of the picture.)</p>
<p>I asked her why she was running as a Republican. &#8220;Because of my personal values,&#8221; she said. And what did her African-American friends think of it? &#8220;People tend to vote the party without thinking about it too much. They don&#8217;t know the details. But when I tell the people in my church, for example,&#8221; she said, that the Democrats may have been for civil rights but, &#8220;they&#8217;re in favor of abortion and the homosexual agenda, people say, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know that.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is somewhat hard to believe, given the never-ending wonderwall of negative television ads&#8211;although, significantly, I haven&#8217;t seen any ads that vamped on the &#8220;homosexual agenda.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not hard to believe that bright conservative African-American (and Latino) candidates like Mays are going to have a piece of the American future.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3475181"></div>
<p>The Republicans have given Democrats the gift of intolerance in a rapidly-changing country. A Republican officeholder in Tennessee told me privately, &#8220;If we could get immigration solved, a lot of conservative, church-going, business-owning Hispanics would be a natural fit for our party.&#8221; This is not a new thought: it was at the heart of Karl Rove&#8217;s party-building mantra. As time passes, though, I sense that many more Republican office-holders are seeing the wisdom and efficacy, and also the justice, of this path. I&#8217;d be surprised in a Republican Congress didn&#8217;t come up with <em>some</em> immigration plan in the next term. The problem is that nativism is as compelling as ever down among the grass roots.</p>
<p>The Democrats, meanwhile, seem smug and bereft of any significant ideas for reforming a government that everyone I&#8217;ve met on this road trip&#8211;everyone&#8211;assumes is too big, broken and inept. Granted, it&#8217;s the South&#8230;but the news in the world is grim and scary. &#8220;Given what&#8217;s happened this week,&#8221; says Tom Cotton, noting the Secret Service and Ebola breaches, &#8220;it&#8217;s not easy to argue that the government is doing its job very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>And you can bet that Leon Panetta&#8217;s bombshell portrayal of President Obama as easily disappointed and unwilling to fight will find its way to the public&#8211;those sorts of characterizations always do&#8211;and have an impact, especially on disappointed Democrats in the coming election.</p>
<p>As I proceed on these road trips, year after year, the levels of disgust and cynicism just seem to compound. I&#8217;ll have more to say about that in my print column this week.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3475181"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

He did it in a video and letter sent to supporters. He thus becomes the first official challenger to Hillary Clinton, who has not yet gone exploratory, on the Democratic side.<\/p>\n<p>Webb is interesting. He is not your standard-issue politician. He is a decorated former Marine, perhaps the best war novelist of the Vietnam generation, Secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan. His one term in the Senate was protean, with Webb focusing on issues as diverse as the reestablishment of relations with Burma, and prison reform, and the new GI bill for Iraq-Afghanistan veterans.<\/p>\n<p>He will be a refreshing presence on the campaign trail. He doesn&#8217;t talk like a politician. He can be blunt and combative. He has taken strong populist economic stands and was a strong opponent of the war in Iraq. In fact, Webb goes in strong whenever he takes a stand. He&#8217;ll certainly be fun to watch during debates (he was a boxer at Annapolis).<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;d have to call him a longshot, of course. But I suspect he&#8217;ll be one of those long shots who have the power to shape a campaign with new ideas and sharp arguments. He will certainly cause Clinton some populist agita, should she run.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Jim%20Webb%20is%20Running%20%7C%20TIME&body=Jim%20Webb%20is%20Running%0A%0AHe%27s%20a%20long%20shot%2C%20but%20could%20give%20Hillary%20heartburn%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598255%2Fjim-webb-is-running%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598255%2Fjim-webb-is-running%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f64n&text=Former%20Virginia%20senator%20Jim%20Webb%20is%20officially%20running%20for%20president.&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3598255%2Fjim-webb-is-running%2F&title=Jim+Webb+is+Running\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3598255\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3598255\/jim-webb-is-running\/\" data-title=\"Jim Webb is Running\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Mike didn&rsquo;t know that I had written it &mdash; I was still anonymous &mdash; and I&rsquo;d never met him, but I felt safe. He wouldn&rsquo;t turn the satire into burlesque. He would treat the characters with respect.<\/p>\n<p>The project turned out to be something of a disappointment for him. A good part of the book&rsquo;s sexiness was wrapped in the mystery of the author&rsquo;s identity, and when I was outed, the mystery was solved. But Mike gave it all the charm and intelligence he could muster, which was limitless. One day on the set, he and Emma Thompson &mdash; another class act &mdash; started talking about how various stage actors apply their talents to the art of the bow. Within minutes, they were demonstrating. They took turns, hilariously, tiptoeing and dashing onto the stage, bold and shy, tearful and arrogant and brilliant. <em>You love me? I&rsquo;m so flattered. Amazed. Shocked. Well, of course, you love me. You damn well better love me, after what I just did for you. (I&rsquo;m touched that you love me, anyway.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Mike&rsquo;s world was like that. The observations were always acute, the intelligence was there to delight, not to dominate. He was relentlessly gracious, clever and generous. There was no pretense or edge to him. We took several long plane trips together, with our wives. He was incredibly generous, bringing us along for the ride when <em>Primary Colors<\/em> was chosen to open the Cannes Film Festival. The conversation was as good as it gets, not just showbiz stories, but serious ramblings about books and theater and psychology, and the inherent awkwardness of journalism. And wordplay, sly and delectable, always. There was a benign magic to his presence; even when the plane landed, our feet hardly touched the ground.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3597167\"

You bet he can. He has the power to set law-enforcement priorities. In 2012, Barack Obama ordered that children brought across the border by their parents and raised in the U.S.&#8211;the so-called Dream Generation&#8211;should not be targeted for deportation. He can expand that ruling to their parents and others. Both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush took similar actions on a smaller scale. The question is, why on earth would the President want to do it now, after the disastrous election of 2014? Newly minted Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said it would be like &#8220;waving a red flag in front of a bull,&#8221; which may have been more artful than literal. McConnell also said that he wouldn&#8217;t shut down the government (nor will the Republican leadership move toward impeachment). The President may have simply calculated that signing his executive actions would be more like waving a tissue in front of a goat.<\/p>\n<p>It is not impossible that Obama is playing some hard-nosed politics here, even if his primary motivation is soft-nosed and idealistic. It is simple humanitarian justice not to separate families by deporting the parents of the Dream Generation. If John Boehner had brought last year&#8217;s bipartisan Senate immigration bill to a vote in the House, the situation might have been happily resolved. &#8220;But it&#8217;s like waiting for a bus that never comes,&#8221; says David Axelrod, a former Obama aide. The Republican definition of immigration reform is unacceptable to most Democrats. It consists of more money for border security and a fast track for skilled foreigners who want to immigrate; it does not include a path to legality for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here. Obama no doubt calculated that negotiations with the GOP on this issue were futile. On top of that, the President may not be too pleased with the members of his inner circle who told him to delay his executive actions last summer for &#8220;political&#8221; reasons, as he so awkwardly put it&#8211;that is, to save some Democratic Senate candidates who ultimately could not be saved. This President does not like to come off as tawdry or political. A quick executive move now is a way to rectify the games he&#8217;s played with Latinos.<\/p>\n<p>But it also may be effective politics. In the long term, every time the Republicans start screaming and stomping about illegal Mexicans, it cements the Latino relationship with the Democratic Party, a demographic boon. There will certainly be a lot of screaming when Obama goes ahead with his plan&#8211;and then we will celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas, a traditionally fallow political period, and the immigration issue will be ancient history by the time McConnell convenes his Republican-majority Senate in January. Hence, another calculation: Despite the immigration order, the Republicans will still want to do business with the President. They will want to demonstrate that gridlock was all Harry Reid&#8217;s fault. The Republican Senators up for re-election in 2016 will need some bacon to bring home. There are trade bills that Republicans will certainly want to pass, and infrastructure bills, and perhaps even some tax reform. Obama will share the credit for those middling triumphs, and he&#8217;ll seem tough besides, having blasted through the &#8220;red flag&#8221; and gotten stuff done.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3596973\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"6\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3899864728001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f5JH\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3899864728001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p>But there will be consequences. By moving ahead with the immigration plan, Obama sacrifices any leeway he might have had with Republicans on a range of more difficult issues. He was going to have a tough time selling an Iran nuclear deal&#8211;if there is such a deal&#8211;to Congress, but it could become impossible now. There will be all sorts of Obamacare challenges, some of which might have been avoided if the President had not pierced the illusion of comity. Democrats will argue that Obama was played for a sucker every time he anticipated the possibility of Republican compromise, and there is a lot to that. But that may well have been the last war. The coming legislative battles could be more subtle and pliable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He may be trying to goad us into doing something stupid&#8221; like shutting down the government or moving toward impeachment, says Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221; Indeed, Republicans have been talking in more surgical fiscal terms&#8211;defunding specific programs, like those that would implement the executive actions, rather than a wholesale shutdown. Worse, Obama&#8217;s immigration actions, noble as they might be, fly in the face of the national mood. At a moment when the public desperately wants some sort of reconciliation, he is sticking a finger in McConnell&#8217;s eye. After playing the reasonable grownup for the first six years of his presidency, he is giving up the high ground.<\/p>\n<p>TO READ JOE&#8217;S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com\/swampland<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"7\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3891588699001-7\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/wp.me\/p5HMd-f5JH\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3891588699001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3596973\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone%20%7C%20TIME&body=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone%0A%0AThe%20President%20has%20good%20reason%20to%20bypass%20Congress.%20But%20he%E2%80%99ll%20pay%20a%20price%0D%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596973%2Ftackling-immigration-alone%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596973%2Ftackling-immigration-alone%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f5JH&text=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3596973%2Ftackling-immigration-alone%2F&title=Tackling+Immigration+Alone\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3596973\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596973\/tackling-immigration-alone\/\" data-title=\"Tackling Immigration Alone\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=Tackling%20Immigration%20Alone&amp;publicationDate=11\/20\/2014&amp;author=Joe%20Klein&amp;contentID=3596973&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

Things like tone of voice, body language and facial expression can make all the difference.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/timeinterstellarcover.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\"><em>Interstellar<\/em>, Where No Movie Has Gone Before<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547825\/nucor-tries-to-reverse-decline-in-american-steelmaking\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Last Men of Steel<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547828\/review-interstellar-christopher-nolan\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Review: <em>Interstellar\u2019s<\/em> Wonder of Worlds Beyond<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>I first met Lew Hicks 13 years ago, when he was part of the most rigorous and creative police-training program ever attempted in the U.S. It was called the Police Corps, and it was founded by Adam Walinsky, a crusty and contentious former Marine and aide to Robert F. Kennedy. After the Detroit riots in 1967&#8211;43 civilians were killed and hundreds injured&#8211;Walinsky spent the next 20 years studying police practices, from the pavement up. His original thought was to create an elite program that would lure graduates from top colleges to do four years of service in return for scholarship money and a fast track to graduate school. In the end, the recruits mostly came from state colleges, and they were kids who wanted to become cops anyway. Bill Clinton was the first board chairman of the Police Corps, and his Administration funded the program in 1995.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3583137\"><\/div>\n<p>Training was the heart of the Corps. It was full-time residential, a form of boot camp. It was far more physical than routine training&#8211;the graduates were superfit&#8211;but the mental conditioning was rigorous as well. Indeed, it very much resembled the training the military provides for special operators like SEALs and Green Berets. It was situational: actors and retired cops were hired to play miscreants, and recruits were judged on how well they responded to spur-of-the-moment situations. Even the firing range was situational: it was paintball, and you could easily be &#8220;shot&#8221; if you made the wrong call. There was required reading about urban poverty, police work and leadership. Recruits were required to mentor troubled boys and girls. And Hicks taught them how to be: how to use their hands, how to present themselves, how to protect themselves. &#8220;I can pick out the Police Corps graduates on the street just by the way they stand,&#8221; said Baltimore police chief Ed Norris, who was one of the first to embrace the Corps. In the end, Walinsky produced more than 1,000 of the best-trained police officers in the country, and many are still on the job.<\/p>\n<p>The Police Corps was tiny and expensive. There was all sorts of opposition to it. Liberals preferred that the money be spent on antipoverty programs. Conservatives liked the idea but preferred that the money not be spent at all. It was killed by George W. Bush, at which point federal spending on police programs went entirely in the wrong direction by providing local cops with militarized up-armored vehicles, cammies, Kevlar, sniper rifles. This, at a moment when the military, especially the Army, was moving toward retraining its troops in a way that resembled the Police Corps. &#8220;We want them to be able to make moral decisions under pressure on the basis of incomplete information,&#8221; General David Petraeus once told me, using almost the same words as Hicks.<\/p>\n<p>The public conversation since the death of Michael Brown has largely been a waste of time. Remonstrating about race is important, but wouldn&#8217;t it be more useful to talk about training&#8211;not just for police officers, but teachers too? Good training costs money, but we need to have a conversation about how we currently spend money. These are the people, after all, who shape our lives and sometimes, tragically, our deaths.<\/p>\n<p>TO READ JOE&#8217;S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com\/swampland<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3583137\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Corps%20Values%20%7C%20TIME&body=Corps%20Values%0A%0ATo%20avoid%20another%20Ferguson%2C%20we%20should%20be%20taking%20a%20lesson%20on%20police%20training%20from%20the%20SEALs%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3583137%2Fcorps-values%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3583137%2Fcorps-values%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f28x&text=Corps%20Values&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3583137%2Fcorps-values%2F&title=Corps+Values\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3583137\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583137\/corps-values\/\" data-title=\"Corps Values\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=Corps%20Values&amp;publicationDate=11\/13\/2014&amp;author=Joe%20Klein&amp;contentID=3583137&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

No doubt, the Republican sweep can be attributed to the unloved Obama, and to the fact that Presidents usually fare badly in their sixth-year election, and to the states in play, which favored the Republicans. But the Democratic candidates were weak and inept; they seemed defensive, reflexive, played out. They pretty much limited themselves to women&#8217;s issues, and those were clearly not enough to convince a frightened and frustrated country.<\/p>\n<p>I watched Clinton speak three times during the campaign, and she limited herself to women&#8217;s issues too, but she did it cleverly. The emphasis was on economics rather than reproductive rights. She was especially good on the economic impact of pay equity: working women would have more money to spend, and they would spend it on consumer goods, which would create jobs&#8211;the opposite of trickle-down economics. She told specific personal stories about her difficulties as a working mom. She spoke slowly, softly, far more confidently than she had in past campaigns. There was a two-tiered rationale for her message: she was spot-on the Democrats&#8217; national pitch, a good soldier selling the blue brand, but the emphasis on women&#8217;s rights also redressed a failing from her 2008 campaign. She had run on &#8220;experience&#8221; then and downplayed the fact that she was a piece of history: the first plausible woman to run for President. She doesn&#8217;t have to worry about experience now; everyone knows she has it. The question is, how does she play to her strengths as a woman if she chooses to run? (And I assume she will.) And how does she convince voters that she&#8217;s not the same old, same old?<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3560468\"><\/div>\n<p>The 2014 exit polls indicated that both political parties are roundly disdained. The Republicans earned their enmity because of their angry, intransigent extremism, but they may be emerging from the swamp. Their candidates this year were more moderate (though they still pandered shamelessly to the party&#8217;s paranoid base). Even Mitch McConnell was making postelection noises about getting stuff done in Washington. This raises a potential problem for Democrats. It could put a crimp in one of their strongest arguments: We&#8217;re not Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>There are two even larger, perhaps existential problems for the Dems. They are the party of government, and people don&#8217;t like government. They don&#8217;t think it works. The botched rollout of Obamacare is far more persuasive to many people than its ensuing successes. Additionally, Democrats have allowed themselves to be lulled by demographics. They are strong among growing blocs: women, young people, minorities. Consequently, they have come to seem a party of identities rather than issues. They don&#8217;t speak to a larger, unifying sense of America; they speak to women and try to get out the vote among blacks, Latinos and students. They have come to seem opportunistic rather than optimistic.<\/p>\n<p>The Obama Presidency is crippled, not dead. There will be opportunities for compromise and even triumph. But the Democrats are now Hillary Clinton&#8217;s party. She will be challenged for the nomination, and she will have to adjust to new political realities. She will also have to figure out a way to seem fresh, aggressive and optimistic&#8211;the precise opposite of the candidates the Democrats put forward in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>TO READ JOE&#8217;S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com\/swampland<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3560468\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Is%20This%20Hillary%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20Moment%3F%20%7C%20TIME&body=Is%20This%20Hillary%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20Moment%3F%0A%0A%20To%20win%20in%202016%2C%20she%20will%20need%20to%20appear%20fresh%2C%20aggressive%20and%20optimistic%0D%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3560468%2Fis-this-hillary-clintons-moment%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3560468%2Fis-this-hillary-clintons-moment%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-eWeU&text=Is%20This%20Hillary%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20Moment%3F&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3560468%2Fis-this-hillary-clintons-moment%2F&title=Is+This+Hillary+Clinton%E2%80%99s+Moment%3F\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3560468\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3560468\/is-this-hillary-clintons-moment\/\" data-title=\"Is This Hillary Clinton\u2019s Moment?\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=Is%20This%20Hillary%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20Moment%3F&amp;publicationDate=11\/06\/2014&amp;author=Joe%20Klein&amp;contentID=3560468&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Ideas","slug":"ideas","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/ideas\/","description":"TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary and expertise on the most compelling events in news, society, and culture.

He stands in contrast to Greg Orman, an independent running for Senate in Kansas, who refuses to tell voters whether he&#8217;d caucus as a Republican or a Democrat&#8211;no small thing, since his first vote may determine which party controls the Senate. This has been a craven, silly campaign on all sides. It has been a boom year for incompetent candidates, accompanied by the long-term decline of those with anything interesting to say. The advertising was, as always, atrocious, but it seemed more influential than ever because of the prevailing vacuity. Important issues were raised, but there was precious little actual discussion of them. Republicans wanted to talk about the perils of illegal immigration, but Democrats, by and large, refused to make the strong moral and practical argument in favor of reform&#8211;an argument embodied in a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate with significant Republican support. And when Democrats raised the no-brainer issue of equal pay for equal work, the Republicans simply refused to engage.<\/p>\n<p>On a recent trip through the South, I asked several dozen politicians of both parties to name the one big thing they wanted to accomplish in Washington. They fled specificity for the safer precincts of banality&#8211;&#8221;balance the budget&#8221; for Republicans, &#8220;work across the aisle&#8221; for Democrats. No one had the courage to cite a specific idea: Here are six anachronistic weapons systems I&#8217;d like to cut; or, We should exempt small banks from the onerous Dodd-Frank regulations. They had been schooled well. You don&#8217;t want to take a specific stand on anything you don&#8217;t have to. People might not like your position. Popular democracy always bumbles toward the trivial, but the dullness of this year&#8217;s campaign has been paralytic.<\/p>\n<p>And yet there are important matters at stake on Nov. 4&#8211;not least of which is whether Mitch McConnell&#8217;s Republicans will gain control of the Senate. A week out, it was still an open question. But even if the Republicans stumble, the results could yield some hints about the immediate future of American politics. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be looking at:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Democrats And Women<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Chris Matthews once called the Democrats the &#8220;mommy&#8221; party. They were the meta-mommy party in this campaign. The heart of the matter was four female Democrats in hot Southern Senate races: Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, Michelle Nunn in Georgia and the incumbents Kay Hagan in North Carolina and Mary Landrieu in Louisiana. Each emphasized women&#8217;s issues&#8211;equal pay, parental leave, abortion rights&#8211;in the hope of luring undecided, independent women to the fold. This has been page 1 in the Democratic playbook for at least 40 years. (Page 2 is scaring people about the loss of old-age entitlements.) It has been effective and still may be&#8211;but it has never before carried the electoral burden that it does this year. The alleged toxicity of Barack Obama has made it unsafe for Democrats to discuss much else.<\/p>\n<p>The party was boosted by the failed Bush wars in 2006, 2008 and 2012, but Democrats have been boggled by what to say about ISIS in 2014. They&#8217;ve had no significant new ideas, foreign or domestic, on offer. And they&#8217;ve been too afraid to tout Obama&#8217;s complicated successes&#8211;the stimulus package that prevented a depression, the health care plan that may actually be working, and relative order at the border (a result of many years of security enhancements and a diminished flow of illegals during recent rough economic times). The argument on women&#8217;s economic issues is strong. It remains to be seen whether baby boomers who boast remarkable three-month, 3-D sonograms of their grandchildren will be quite so militant about abortion rights in the future. The fate of women&#8217;s issues, in the South and elsewhere, will have an impact on whether the party has to start rethinking its message going forward. It may not be able to count on Republicans&#8217; continuing their boorish ways. Unless, of course, the conservatives win and overread the results this year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"8\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3872857636001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/10BgqUD\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3872857636001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<p><strong>2. Republicans And Purple States<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3547829\"><\/div>\n<p>Iowa and New Hampshire are mythic presidential-primary states; Colorado is a crucial, purple general-election state. All three have been trending toward the Democrats in recent campaigns. All three are senatorial toss-ups this year. In Iowa, the Republicans are boosted by an energetic candidate, Joni Ernst, facing a dreadful Democrat, Bruce Braley&#8211;who opened the campaign with a lawyerly slur against Chuck Grassley, the other U.S. Senator from Iowa. Grassley isn&#8217;t a lawyer&#8211;he&#8217;s well known and beloved as an Iowa farmer&#8211;and he&#8217;ll chair the Judiciary Committee if the Republicans win the Senate. This would be a big problem, Braley warned, as if lawyers weren&#8217;t considered more toxic than farmers by most Iowa voters. But there&#8217;s no excuse for the tight races that estimable Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Mark Udall find themselves struggling through in New Hampshire and Colorado. Actually, there&#8217;s one excuse: Obama. He has been the Republicans&#8217; one and only issue across the country, and it might well work. But what if it doesn&#8217;t? What if Obama&#8211;like women&#8217;s issues for the Democrats&#8211;is being overplayed?<\/p>\n<p>This goes to the question of the Republicans&#8217; strategy if they do win the Senate. Will they decide to make the Oval Office a veto factory by passing conservative wish-list bills, like repealing Obamacare, and sending them on to the White House? Or will they seek deals on immigration, infrastructure improvement and maybe even health care? Recent history suggests continued warfare. But that supposes that all of the American people despise the President as much as the Republican base does. The past six years have been a juvenile, name-calling fiesta for the likes of Rush Limbaugh, who prospers when Republicans are out of power. It is very tempting for the party to stay that course. I wouldn&#8217;t bet against it. But Republicans found in 1998 that compromising with a Democratic President could produce odd results, like balanced budgets and a Republican presidential victory in 2000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Kansas Rejoins The Mainstream<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Senate race between the aforementioned independent, Greg Orman, and Republican stalwart Pat Roberts is curious. But the plight of the current governor, Sam Brownback, may be historic. Brownback has pitched his tent atop the quicksand of voodoo economics. The results are the same as when Ronald Reagan tried massive tax cuts in 1981: they have blown a giant hole in tax revenue. Unsustainable budget cuts&#8211;in education, in everything&#8211;have resulted. Brownback points out that the economy eventually revived under Reagan. True enough, but only after Reagan agreed to several huge tax increases and the tight-money magic of Paul Volcker&#8217;s Federal Reserve wrung inflation out of the system. Brownback&#8217;s Kansas disaster has caused the local Chamber of Commerce to rise up and support his Democratic opponent, Paul Davis, and this may have long-term consequences for Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>The Chamber and other business groups have always opposed higher taxes and tighter regulations; their tacit support helped launch the Tea Party. But what if business groups, large and small, decide that fiscal responsibility is more important than tax cuts? Traditionally, business has also supported spending on education and infrastructure. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the high-tech community support immigration reform. What if the national business community follows the Kansas example and reshuffles its priorities? The Republican Party may well have to reshuffle its priorities too, and the myth of extreme supply-side economics might finally be put to rest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. The Quiet Jungle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Last spring I wrote about the new electoral possibilities in California, given its system of open primaries&#8211;also called jungle primaries. This allows the two top vote getters in the primary to compete in the general election, regardless of party. The aim was to rouse more centrist candidates. The mammoth 53-seat California congressional delegation has yielded only two same-party finals in 2014. In District 17, a moderate Democrat named Ro Khanna is challenging the traditional Democratic incumbent Mike Honda; in District 4, the Tea Party incumbent Tom McClintock is facing a more moderate Republican challenger, a West Point graduate named Art Moore. If the moderates win, it may encourage other centrists to try next time. But the incumbents seem to have a slight edge in both races.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. The Omniscient Pollster<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2012, Nate Silver of the FiveThirtyEight website correctly predicted the presidential results in every state. Consequently&#8211;and since the politicians aren&#8217;t having very many rallies anymore&#8211;the press has paid even more than its usual excessive attention to polling in the 2014 campaign. Very elaborate compilations by different sources have given the Republicans a monumental advantage in taking the Senate this year. But there&#8217;s a problem: the Republicans don&#8217;t have a monumental advantage in any of the key toss-up states. The polling has most of those races within the margin of error. And polling on down-ballot races is notoriously less accurate than it is on the presidential level. I won&#8217;t be surprised if the Republicans win the election, but it is possible they won&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>It may be too much to ask that we journalists stop trying to do what we do worst&#8211;predicting the outcomes of races&#8211;and start doing what we should do best: hounding the candidates into specific answers on difficult questions. My sense this year has been that most politicians now assume that the vexing need to deal with journalists is pretty much over, unless they commit a mouth misdemeanor or something unseemly emerges about their past. They may be right. The media aren&#8217;t as powerful as they used to be. Budgets are tighter. There aren&#8217;t as many Walter Robinsons around to unearth the last thing that the public has come to expect: the shocking positive story.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3547829\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=5%20Things%20to%20Watch%20for%20in%20the%20Midterm%20Elections%20%7C%20TIME&body=5%20Things%20to%20Watch%20for%20in%20the%20Midterm%20Elections%0A%0AWill%20Mitch%20McConnell%E2%80%99s%20Republicans%20gain%20control%20of%20the%20Senate%3F%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3547829%2F5-things-to-watch-for-in-the-midterm-elections%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3547829%2F5-things-to-watch-for-in-the-midterm-elections%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F10BgqUD&text=5%20things%20to%20watch%20for%20in%20the%20midterm%20elections&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3547829%2F5-things-to-watch-for-in-the-midterm-elections%2F&title=5+Things+to+Watch+for+in+the+Midterm+Elections\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3547829\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547829\/5-things-to-watch-for-in-the-midterm-elections\/\" data-title=\"5 Things to Watch for in the Midterm Elections\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=5%20Things%20to%20Watch%20for%20in%20the%20Midterm%20Elections&amp;publicationDate=10\/30\/2014&amp;author=Joe%20Klein&amp;contentID=3547829&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

She actually shook her fist at one point, but this was not a pitchfork speech&#8230; and not a long one, either. I&#8217;ve always been impressed by Warren&#8217;s ability to explain the complexities of financial policy in a way that civilians can understand, but she didn&#8217;t have much time for that. She stuck to the job at hand: praising Coakley as a populist hero. And she did it very well, if not transcendently.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton was obviously the star of the show. She spoke <em>after<\/em> Coakley, and was given much more time than Warren. She was greeted, as both Warren and Coakley were, by a roar, though her roar may have been a smidgeon louder than the others&#8217;. She wasted no time in praising Warren as someone willing to &#8220;give it to those who deserve to get it.&#8221; (She also praised all the other elected officials present, especially Coakley.)<\/p>\n<p>It will be said that Warren emphasized her break-up-the-banks populism while Clinton spoke about women&#8217;s issues, and that is true&#8211;although Clinton did offer one passing acknowledgment of Coakley as someone who was willing to fight against &#8220;corrupt financial institutions&#8221; during her years as Mass. Atty. General. But that wasn&#8217;t the most important thing about her speech. Actually, there were three important things:<\/p>\n<p>1. The emphasis on women&#8217;s rights, especially equal pay, was spot on the Democrats&#8217; most successful message in these 2014 campaigns. She told a personal story about Chelsea getting sick at the age of two, on a day when Clinton had to appear in court as a young lawyer. She told it well, making clear her anguish throughout the day, the difficulty of finding someone to take care of Chelsea (finally, &#8220;a trusted friend&#8221; volunteered to help) and the relief when she got home to find Chelsea better and reading with the friend. This was the opposite of her awkward &#8220;poor&#8221;-mouthing during her book tour. It was recognizably life-sized and very effective.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3537802\"><\/div>\n<p>2. The story was striking to old-timers like me because this was exactly the sort of message she rarely delivered when she ran for President in 2008. She took the advice of her pollster-strategist Mark Penn and emphasized her experience rather than her gender, which was disastrously stupid. Her life-long obsession with women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s issues is a calling more than a message. Although, a message it certainly is, grounded and practical&#8230;and she laid out the financial benefits of equal pay in a way that might have made the Big Dog proud: she talked about the things that moms could buy with the extra money. Food for the kids, better daycare, maybe even a car&#8211;think about the impact on the economy! (Actually, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if her husband had helped a little with that one.)<\/p>\n<p>3. She spoke slowly, confidently, conversationally. No screaming. The audience listened intently, at times losing track of what they were supposed to do for applause lines. She didn&#8217;t try to rouse them, except at the end&#8211;when her peroration began inaudible because of the cheers.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it was packaged. Almost everything is, in politics these days. But it didn&#8217;t <em>seem<\/em> packaged. There&#8217;s a long and winding road to travel between now and 2016, but she seems to have given smarter and subtler thought to how she&#8217;s going to present herself than she did last time.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3537802\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Clinton%20and%20Warren%2C%20Together%20at%20Last%20%7C%20TIME&body=Clinton%20and%20Warren%2C%20Together%20at%20Last%0A%0ABoth%20showed%20up%20in%20Boston%20to%20support%20Democratic%20candidate%20for%20Governor%20of%20Massachusetts%20Martha%20Coakley%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3537802%2Fclinton-and-warren-together-at-last%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3537802%2Fclinton-and-warren-together-at-last%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1tRU11U&text=Clinton%20and%20Warren%2C%20Together%20at%20Last&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3537802%2Fclinton-and-warren-together-at-last%2F&title=Clinton+and+Warren%2C+Together+at+Last\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3537802\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3537802\/clinton-and-warren-together-at-last\/\" data-title=\"Clinton and Warren, Together at Last\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

Two days later, Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senator from Kentucky, was asked who she voted for in 2008 and 2012. Her answer was similarly excruciating, and foolish. She cited the privacy of the ballot box.

This is the part where I&#8217;m supposed to defend the President. He really did pull us out of a probable depression with an effective stimulus package; the economy continues to wheeze, but it wheezes forward. He really did make history by producing a universal health care plan that will not be repealed but will be reformed over time. The nonstop Republican critique that these programs were &#8220;disasters&#8221; has been rendered ridiculous. (In Kentucky, Mitch McConnell had to pull a Mark Pryor on that state&#8217;s very successful version of Obama&#8217;s plan.) The President has been sane and relatively moderate in his selection of Supreme Court Justices. His proposed job-growth policies would probably work, if given a chance by the Republicans.<\/p>\n<p>He has been sane, too, in his foreign policy, for the most part. Those who say he should have been tougher on ISIS by arming the Syrian rebels&#8211;talking to you, Madam Secretary and Mr. Panetta&#8211;are wildly wrong. We would have wound up arming ISIS. There is precedent for this: we offered a fabulous buffet of armaments to the Iraqis, who left them for ISIS as they turned tail and ran in Mosul. Obama did cleave to the dreadful Nouri al-Maliki too uncritically&#8211;and thereby allowed a corrupt Shi&#8217;ite fragment to call its sectarian tune. That was Obama&#8217;s fundamental Iraq mistake.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3512660\"><\/div>\n<p>But who hasn&#8217;t made an Iraq mistake over the past decade? The proof of Obama&#8217;s moderation can be found in the blundering simplicity of his critics: the neo-imperialists who think we can actually determine, by force of arms, what happens in the Middle East; the left-libertarians who don&#8217;t think we have the right to protect ourselves from terrorism by launching drone strikes, conducting special operations and tracking terrorist phone calls. Obama has stood as a bulwark against the irrationalities of both parties.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the case for Obama. I really believe it. But I also believe that Panetta has a point. It is about the ethereal nature of true leadership. I remember writing a similar defense of Jimmy Carter nearly 40 years ago: a great number of the policies that Ronald Reagan was later given credit for launching&#8211;Paul Volcker&#8217;s tough inflation cure; a bristling stand against the Soviets, including intermediate missiles in Europe&#8211;were Carter&#8217;s policies first. He slugged his way to a historic peace treaty in the Middle East, but he didn&#8217;t convey two essential American qualities: forcefulness and optimism. Indeed, if you look at his infamous &#8220;malaise&#8221; speech, it&#8217;s a riveting piece of work, containing more tough truth about the country than the pile of Democratic utterances in the ensuing decade. I remember thinking, Poor Jimmy: history has led America to a rut, and we&#8217;ll never be as powerful as we once were. Reagan proved me young and foolish. Some of his achievements are illusory or attributable to Carter policies (as in economics), but the man knew how to lead.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t say that for Obama. I sense that Panetta is right about his unwillingness to fight. Lately, the President&#8217;s body language has too often conveyed disgust and cynicism. He seems defeated by the trivial pursuits of the media and his opponents. He does not have the sunny conviction necessary to carry the country through a period of near biblical plagues and wars.

Kevin and Lois Martello, a dentist and speech therapist, respectively, had put together a group of 15 friends and neighbors to talk politics, and it was pretty intense from the start. I asked Lee Foshee, who had raised the post-office question, where he&#8217;d heard that. He told me he had several sources. One of them may have been the right-wing Breitbart website, I later learned, which has been tracking ammo sales to federal agencies. Breitbart didn&#8217;t mention the price-raising strategy, but Bill Kostelka, a certified public accountant, confirmed that he&#8217;d had to stand in line to buy .22-caliber rounds recently. (For the record: the U.S. Postal Inspection Service is armed and needs ammo from time to time.)<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-partner\" data-name=\"rr-partner\"><div class=\"read-more-list\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h\">More<\/h6><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3583133\/detroit-turns-up\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Detroit Turns Up<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3560484\/life-after-war\/\" class=\"read-more-list-article\" data-event=\"rr-more\">Life After War<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/storyline\/michael-brown-shooting\/pair-suspected-trying-acquire-bombs-ferguson-protests-n254021?cid=par-time_20141122\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Feds Suspect Pair Sought Bombs for Ferguson Protests <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/crime-courts\/ohio-men-wrongly-convicted-murder-after-39-years-released-n253356?cid=par-time_20141122\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Two Ohio Men Wrongly Convicted of Murder Walk Free <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/fsu-shooter-myron-may-left-message-i-do-not-want-n253436?cid=par-time_20141122\" class=\"read-more-partner-article\" data-event=\"rr-partner\" target=\"_blank\">FSU Shooter Left Message: 'I Do Not Want to Die in Vain' <span>NBC News<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>It&#8217;s hard to know what to believe,&#8221; said Lois Martello, the host, who seemed as nonplussed by the post-office-ammo conspiracy as I was.

There was more concern about government waste than about unseen wealth. Indeed, another chorus of consternation ensued, this time about food stamps. Waylon Bates, the principal of the local middle school, said he&#8217;d seen people &#8220;buying T-bone steaks and giant bottles of orange soda&#8221; with government scrip. Others said they&#8217;d seen the very same thing. And Foshee said he&#8217;d seen long lines at a combination liquor store and check-cashing place&#8211;a fine establishment, no doubt&#8211;on the day the Social Security disability checks came out each month.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard the T-bone steak and orange-soda riff a number of times on road trips in recent years. It is always T-bone steaks. Sometimes it&#8217;s dog food too. Is it true? Maybe so; there are food-stamp abuses, no doubt. Or maybe it happened once, someone saw it, and the story spread, sprayed into the atmosphere by talk radio. It is now an urban (and rural) legend. The food-stamp stories mix with more purposeful fantasies spread by interest groups, like the National Rifle Association&#8217;s constant spew that the government wants to &#8220;take away&#8221; your guns rather than merely regulate their use. And then there are the immigrant stories: Kostelka heard about a carload of Mexicans stopped by the local police without driver&#8217;s licenses or proof of residency. &#8220;And they were given a fine and set free,&#8221; he said. True, no doubt, but incomplete: fewer would-be immigrants have been crossing the border in recent years, and the Obama Administration has been sending record numbers back home.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3483899\"><\/div>\n<p>Democrats are swimming against the prevailing cynicism as they attempt to retain the Senate this year. Across the South, their candidates are placing a heavy bet on women&#8217;s issues, especially equal pay, and education. In some places, like North Carolina, where a traditional emphasis on education spending has been violated by the Republican state legislature, they have a chance to win. In Louisiana, where Senator Mary Landrieu is facing a virtual candidate named Bill Cassidy&#8211;local reporters claim they can&#8217;t find the guy, and I couldn&#8217;t either&#8211;the incumbent is facing a real hurdle. The hurdle is Barack Obama, about whom the crazy rumors are&#8211;still!&#8211;thick, and the ads are constant: each of the incumbent Democratic Senators running in the Southern states I visited has voted with the President more than 90% of the time. That is one thing every voter who enters the polls will know next month.<\/p>\n<p>There is also an undercurrent of fear&#8211;about ISIS and Ebola&#8211;that does not help the Democrats. Most of the people I talked with don&#8217;t think this federal government is competent to handle anything. And there is an undercurrent of exhaustion, especially among Democrats who have talked themselves silly trying to dispel the rumor fog that has engulfed political discourse. These are stories that stick in the mind and rot the body politic. They are a dominant political currency, and not just in the South.<\/p>\n<p>TO READ JOE&#8217;S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com\/politics<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3483899\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=A%20Troubled%20American%20Moment%20%7C%20TIME&body=A%20Troubled%20American%20Moment%0A%0AAs%20conspiracy%20theories%20abound%2C%20voters%20are%20uncertain%20about%20what%20to%20believe%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3483899%2Fa-troubled-american-moment%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3483899%2Fa-troubled-american-moment%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1v6of0W&text=A%20Troubled%20American%20Moment&via=TIMEIdeas\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3483899%2Fa-troubled-american-moment%2F&title=A+Troubled+American+Moment\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3483899\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3483899\/a-troubled-american-moment\/\" data-title=\"A Troubled American Moment\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n        <div class=\"reprintLink\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s100.copyright.com\/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=TIME&amp;publication=TIME&amp;title=A%20Troubled%20American%20Moment&amp;publicationDate=10\/09\/2014&amp;author=Joe%20Klein&amp;contentID=3483899&amp;orderBeanReset=true\" data-event=\"reprints\" title=\"Click to order a reprint of this article\">Order a Reprint<\/a>\n        <\/div>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Opinion","slug":"opinion","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/opinion\/","description":"Ideas.

Her name was Patricia Mays and she was running for state representative&#8211;as a Republican, against a Democratic incumbent. Mays is young and attractive, and very straight ahead: She has a PhD in industrial engineering from Texas A&amp;M, and she has four issues. They are: abortion, education reform, health care and jobs. We spoke about all of them and she had some interesting ideas, especially in health care where she supports a system of local clinics where the doctors are paid directly by the patients, eliminating the insurance companies. &#8220;Then you could offer a major medical plan on top of that,&#8221; she said. (We didn&#8217;t talk about how this would be funded, but she said, correctly, that it would be a lot cheaper with the insurance companies out of the picture.)<\/p>\n<p>I asked her why she was running as a Republican. &#8220;Because of my personal values,&#8221; she said. And what did her African-American friends think of it? &#8220;People tend to vote the party without thinking about it too much. They don&#8217;t know the details. But when I tell the people in my church, for example,&#8221; she said, that the Democrats may have been for civil rights but, &#8220;they&#8217;re in favor of abortion and the homosexual agenda, people say, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t know that.&#8217;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is somewhat hard to believe, given the never-ending wonderwall of negative television ads&#8211;although, significantly, I haven&#8217;t seen any ads that vamped on the &#8220;homosexual agenda.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not hard to believe that bright conservative African-American (and Latino) candidates like Mays are going to have a piece of the American future.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3475181\"><\/div>\n<p>The Republicans have given Democrats the gift of intolerance in a rapidly-changing country. A Republican officeholder in Tennessee told me privately, &#8220;If we could get immigration solved, a lot of conservative, church-going, business-owning Hispanics would be a natural fit for our party.&#8221; This is not a new thought: it was at the heart of Karl Rove&#8217;s party-building mantra. As time passes, though, I sense that many more Republican office-holders are seeing the wisdom and efficacy, and also the justice, of this path. I&#8217;d be surprised in a Republican Congress didn&#8217;t come up with <em>some<\/em> immigration plan in the next term. The problem is that nativism is as compelling as ever down among the grass roots.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrats, meanwhile, seem smug and bereft of any significant ideas for reforming a government that everyone I&#8217;ve met on this road trip&#8211;everyone&#8211;assumes is too big, broken and inept. Granted, it&#8217;s the South&#8230;but the news in the world is grim and scary. &#8220;Given what&#8217;s happened this week,&#8221; says Tom Cotton, noting the Secret Service and Ebola breaches, &#8220;it&#8217;s not easy to argue that the government is doing its job very well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And you can bet that Leon Panetta&#8217;s bombshell portrayal of President Obama as easily disappointed and unwilling to fight will find its way to the public&#8211;those sorts of characterizations always do&#8211;and have an impact, especially on disappointed Democrats in the coming election.<\/p>\n<p>As I proceed on these road trips, year after year, the levels of disgust and cynicism just seem to compound. I&#8217;ll have more to say about that in my print column this week.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3475181\"><\/div><\/aside><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=A%20Glimmer%20of%20Arkansas%E2%80%99%20Future%20%7C%20TIME&body=A%20Glimmer%20of%20Arkansas%E2%80%99%20Future%0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3475181%2Fa-glimmer-of-arkansas-future%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3475181%2Fa-glimmer-of-arkansas-future%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1oKbKRt&text=A%20glimmer%20of%20Arkansas%27%20future&via=TIMEPolitics\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3475181%2Fa-glimmer-of-arkansas-future%2F&title=A+Glimmer+of+Arkansas%E2%80%99+Future\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3475181\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3475181\/a-glimmer-of-arkansas-future\/\" data-title=\"A Glimmer of Arkansas&amp;#8217; Future\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.
