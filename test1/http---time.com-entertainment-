    <p>Tina Fey is taking her show away from NBC.</p>
<p>The writer-actor-producer&#8217;s new series <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt </em>will now appear on Netflix instead, according to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>.</p>
<p><em>Kimmy Schmidt </em>stars Ellie Kemper from <i>The Office </i>as a woman who starts over in New York City after living in a cult.</p>
<p>Fey&#8217;s relationship with NBC has extended more than a decade. The television star first became famous as a performer on the channel&#8217;s <em>Saturday Night Live </em>program. She eventually became that show&#8217;s head writer before creating <em>30 Rock</em>, another NBC show.</p>

    <p>Jennifer Lawrence reportedly had so much <a href="http://time.com/3578175/jennifer-lawrence-cried-hunger-games/" target="_blank">trouble</a> getting past her nerves that she cried when she had to sing &#8220;The Hanging Tree&#8221; in the latest installment of <em>The Hunger Games.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d probably tell you it was her least favorite day,&rdquo; said Francis Lawrence, the movie&#8217;s director. &ldquo;She was horrified to sing, she cried a little bit in the morning before she had to sing.&#8221;</p>

	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Alan Turing wasn't the only one who suffered</h2>
    <p>The new movie <em>The Imitation</em> game is bringing fresh attention to a dark period in early 20th century, when homosexuals in the U.S. and the U.K. were criminally prosecuted because of their sexuality.</p>
<p>The movie, starring <a href="http://time.com/3596955/the-price-of-genius" target="_blank">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, depicts the life of Alan Turing&mdash;a mathematician, computer scientist and code breaker known as a key architect of the modern computer and an instrumental figure whose skill for breaking Nazi codes helped the allies win World War II.</p>
<div class="video-wrapper" data-pos="1" data-continuous="1"><object id="bc-video-3900256133001-1" class="BrightcoveExperience"><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"><param name="width" value="100%"><param name="height" value="100%"><param name="playerID" value="1847503743001"><param name="isVid" value="true"><param name="isUI" value="true"><param name="dynamicStreaming" value="true"><param name="videoSmoothing" value="true"><param name="autoStart" value="false"><param name="linkBaseURL" value="http://wp.me/p5HMd-f6qb"><param name="includeAPI" value="true"><param name="templateLoadHandler" value="TIME_onTemplateLoad"><param name="templateReadyHandler" value="TIME_onTemplateReady"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="htmlFallback" value="true"><param name="@videoPlayer" value="3900256133001"></object></div>
<p>Despite his genius, Turing was prosecuted in England in 1952 for engaging in a homosexual relationship with a man. In lieu of prison, he was sentenced to take estrogen treatments to reduce his libido, a practice dubbed &#8220;chemical castration.&#8221; In 1954, he killed himself by cyanide poisoning at the age of 41.</p>
<p>The film depicts the Turing&#8217;s unjust prosecution and punishment for homosexuality, though slightly inaccurately (for more information, the <em>Guardian</em> did a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/the-imitation-game-invents-new-slander-to-insult-alan-turing-reel-history" target="_blank">helpful analysis</a> of the film&#8217;s facts).</p>
<p>What happened to Turing was not uncommon in the United Kingdom and the United States during his lifetime in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. In the U.S., it was &#8220;the worst time to be queer because you are not being ignored, you are actively searched for and persecuted,&#8221; said John D&#8217;Emilio, a professor of gay and lesbian studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &#8220;The nice thing about the movie is that it is calling attention to this bit of history that people don&rsquo;t know anything about.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Britain&mdash;where America&#8217;s own sodomy laws originated&mdash;the story begins in 1533, during the reign of Henry the VIII. That year, the Buggery Act made male sex a capital offense in Britain, punishable by death, usually by hanging. That remained the law until 1861, when the sentence was changed from death to prison, usually with hard labor. In 1885, the law was broadened to criminalize &#8220;gross indecency&#8221; a vague, catch-all term used to prosecute anything considered to be deviant sexual behavior outside of sodomy, mostly between men. In 1895, the playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years of prison and hard labor, about which he penned a poem called &#8220;The Balad of Reading Gaol.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Alan Turing&#8217;s life, public concern over the possibility that homosexuals serving in the military or aiding in the war effort could be blackmailed by enemies intensified the stigma of homosexuality in Britain. After Turing was convicted in 1952, the British government took away his security clearance. Turing was exposed after he reported a petty theft to the police, involving his lover. Their relationship was discovered by the police through his reporting of the crime. He pleaded guilty and opted for hormone treatments, known as chemical castration, instead of prison time. He tragically killed himself with cyanide in 1954.</p>
<p>The 1950s, was the beginning of the end for Britain&#8217;s laws against homosexual sex, as the prosecution of prominent people stoked a public backlash against the laws. In 1954, a well known journalist, Peter Wildeblood was convicted of homosexual acts with two prominent and wealthy men, Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, in a public trial that resulted in prison time for all of the men and public opposition to laws against homosexual sex. The trial lead to the creation of the Wolfenden committee of government representatives, ministers, educators, and psychiatrists, which in 1957, published a report recommending the discontinuation of laws against homosexuality.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599607"></div>
<div class="galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded" data-gallery="3594876" data-size="default"></div>
<p>The report eventually led to the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, which ended the criminalization of homosexual sex between consenting men over the age of 21 in Britain and Wales. In 1994, the age was lowered to 18, and in 2003, it was lowered to 16, the same age for consenting heterosexual sex.</p>
<p>The U.S. history is slightly different from Britain&#8217;s. The fervent prosecution of gay sex didn&#8217;t start to happen in earnest until the very period during which Turing lived. The U.S. had anti-sodomy laws inherited from the English settlers, but it wasn&#8217;t until the late 1930s, 40s and 50s, during a period coinciding with the World Wars and a strong strain of Christian morality, that police in the U.S. made it a priority to enforce laws against homosexuals.</p>
<p>As in England, concerns that homosexuals could be blackmailed by Communist spies&mdash;an idea popularized by Senator Joe McCarthy&mdash;drove some of the fervor against homosexuals during that period. In the U.S.&mdash;more so than in Britain, it seems&mdash;the period was marked by increased police enforcement of the laws. Police officers went undercover in public parks where homosexuals went to meet each other for sexual encounters, in order to uncover them. It was a period of fear for homosexuals in America unparalleled before or since. &#8220;This is the height of what I call the homosexual terror in America,&#8221; said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of<em> Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America</em>.</p>
<p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href="http://time.com/3596961/review-the-imitation-game/" target="_blank">TIME reviews <em>The Imitation Game</em></a></p>
<p>During this same period, Eskridge said, states began to pass laws that allowed courts to institutionalize gay people indefinitely in mental institutions for having &#8220;psychotic personalities,&#8221; where were experimented on, lobotomized, and given shock therapy.</p>
<p>As was the case with Turing, the prosecution of gays also denied the U.S. some very bright minds who, but for their homosexuality, might have been allowed to contribute more to society. In the late 1950&#8242;s, Frank Kameny, an astronomer with a Ph.D. from Harvard, was kicked out of the Army Map Service and barred from serving in theUS government because he was a homosexual.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of geniuses of 20th century, the father of modern computers who helped win World War II, who was a lovely person, was destroyed by the anti homosexual terror,&#8221; Eskridge said of Turing.</p>

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.</p>
<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?</p>
<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/19/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime/" target="_blank">decided there was not sufficient evidence</a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.</p>
<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde/">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde</a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.</p>
<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599631"></div>
<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know</em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?</p>
<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.</p>
<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission. That is never an acceptable decision for the chronicler of somebody else&rsquo;s life.</p>

Making that call is a moral calculus: when do the negative aspects of a public figure outweigh the positive? Granted, in Bill Cosby&#8217;s case, we&#8217;re talking about a comedian, but the question is relevant for <em>The Cosby Show</em>&#8216;s legacy. Should I think less of <i>The Cosby Show</i>&#8216;s power to teach and to change perceptions of race in America if it turns out Bill Cosby is a rapist?</p>

For me, <em>The Cosby Show&#8217;s</em> legacy is personal. As a kid, the young Huxtables were among the few children on television with faces that looked like mine living well-adjusted upper middle class existences that resembled my own. When I considered my Cosby experience alongside the actor&#8217;s on-screen persona, a doctor and family man who combined life lessons with old-fashioned humor, I intuitively knew that he couldn&#8217;t be a serial rapist.</p>

Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The </i><i>C</i><i>osby Show</i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?</p>
<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show </i>harm anyone, even indirectly?</p>
<p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href="http://time.com/3599978/cosby-show-reruns-rape/" target="_blank">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show</em>?</a>)</p>
<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3599394"></div>
<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.</p>
<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show</em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son</em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.</p>
<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show </i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href="http://time.com/3596545/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video/" target="_blank">silence</a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.</p><aside class="right-rail-module rr-ad" data-name="rr-ad"><div class="right-rail-ad" id="right-rail-ad-3599394"></div></aside><aside class="right-rail-module rr-share" data-name="rr-share"><span class="social-links">

<p>&ldquo;One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Hill told<em> CBS Pittsburgh</em>. &ldquo;I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned, you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hill eventually ended the relationship when she was 19, despite Cosby paying for Hill&rsquo;s college tuition.</p>
<p>Another woman, Kristina Ruehli, also alleges that she was drugged by Cosby when she was 22, working at a talent agency assistant at Artists Agency Corp, where he was then a client. Ruehli was one of the women named in Andrea Constand&rsquo;s lawsuit against Cosby that was eventually settled.</p>
<p>According to an interview with <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/11/21/kristina-ruehli-says-bill-cosby-drugged-tried-sexually-assault-1965/" target="_blank"><em>Philadelphia Magazine</em></a>, Cosby invited Ruehli to an after party at his house, who was surprised to find that she was the only guest when she arrived. After drinking the drink that Cosby offered to her, Ruehli found herself disoriented and losing consciousness.</p>
<div class="copy-paste-block">
<div class="copy-paste-block">
<p>&ldquo;It was all foggy, and I woke up in the bed. I found myself on the bed, and he had his shirt off. He had unzipped his pants. I was just coming to,&rdquo; Ruehli told <em>Philadelphia Magazine</em>. &ldquo;He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head. He had his cock out, and he had my head pushed close enough to it &mdash; I just remember looking at his stomach hair. And the hair on his chest. I had never seen a black man naked before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruehli said that she threw up and left Cosby&rsquo;s house, and decided to come forward to add credibility to the sexual assault allegations that have been growing hour by hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need money or aggravation,&rdquo; Ruehli added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very wealthy, so I have nothing to gain. But I wanted to come forward to tell the truth to back up other people.&rdquo;</p>

	<h2 class="article-excerpt" itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Nine women have recently accused Cosby of drugging and raping them during the 1970s and ’80s</h2>
    <p>Two channels are sticking with Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>While TV Land has stopped airing repeats of Cosby&rsquo;s iconic NBC sitcom <em>The Cosby Show</em>, two niche basic cable channels that target black viewers have decided to continue running sitcoms starring the actor-comedian.</p>
<p>BET-owned Centric (formerly BET Jazz) confirmed to EW that repeats of <em>Cosby Show </em>will continue. Centric is available in 51 million homes. Asked for the channel&rsquo;s reasoning behind the decision, a spokesperson replied that they&rsquo;re not making any comments about the series at this time.<span id="more-194062"></span></p>
<p>The other channel is called Aspire and it was launched by Magic Johnson in 2012. Aspire airs Cosby&rsquo;s short-lived 1969 sitcom, <em>The Bill Cosby Show</em>, which ran for two seasons. Aspire told EW, &ldquo;We continue to closely monitor the situation. Currently the show is still running.&rdquo; Aspire is available in about 21 million homes.</p>
<p>Nine women have recently accused Cosby of drugging and raping them during the 1970s and &rsquo;80s, allegations the 77-year-old comic has strongly denied through his attorney. In recent weeks, Cosby has canceled at least two TV appearances, NBC has halted development on a new sitcom starring the actor and Netflix has postponed streaming a new Cosby stand-up special.</p>

engaging in a homosexual relationship with a man. In lieu of prison, he was sentenced to take estrogen treatments to reduce his libido, a practice dubbed &#8220;chemical castration.&#8221; In 1954, he killed himself by cyanide poisoning at the age of 41.<\/p>\n<p>The film depicts the Turing&#8217;s unjust prosecution and punishment for homosexuality, though slightly inaccurately (for more information, the <em>Guardian<\/em> did a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/film\/2014\/nov\/20\/the-imitation-game-invents-new-slander-to-insult-alan-turing-reel-history\" target=\"_blank\">helpful analysis<\/a> of the film&#8217;s facts).<\/p>\n<p>What happened to Turing was not uncommon in the United Kingdom and the United States during his lifetime in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. In the U.S., it was &#8220;the worst time to be queer because you are not being ignored, you are actively searched for and persecuted,&#8221; said John D&#8217;Emilio, a professor of gay and lesbian studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. &#8220;The nice thing about the movie is that it is calling attention to this bit of history that people don&rsquo;t know anything about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596955\/the-price-of-genius\/\" target=\"_blank\">The price of genius<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In Britain&mdash;where America&#8217;s own sodomy laws originated&mdash;the story begins in 1533, during the reign of Henry the VIII. That year, the Buggery Act made male sex a capital offense in Britain, punishable by death, usually by hanging. That remained the law until 1861, when the sentence was changed from death to prison, usually with hard labor. In 1885, the law was broadened to criminalize &#8220;gross indecency&#8221; a vague, catch-all term used to prosecute anything considered to be deviant sexual behavior outside of sodomy, mostly between men. In 1895, the playwright Oscar Wilde was convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years of prison and hard labor, about which he penned a poem called &#8220;The Balad of Reading Gaol.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>During Alan Turing&#8217;s life, public concern over the possibility that homosexuals serving in the military or aiding in the war effort could be blackmailed by enemies intensified the stigma of homosexuality in Britain. After Turing was convicted in 1952, the British government took away his security clearance. Turing was exposed after he reported a petty theft to the police, involving his lover. Their relationship was discovered by the police through his reporting of the crime. He pleaded guilty and opted for hormone treatments, known as chemical castration, instead of prison time. He tragically killed himself with cyanide in 1954.<\/p>\n<p>The 1950s, was the beginning of the end for Britain&#8217;s laws against homosexual sex, as the prosecution of prominent people stoked a public backlash against the laws. In 1954, a well known journalist, Peter Wildeblood was convicted of homosexual acts with two prominent and wealthy men, Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, in a public trial that resulted in prison time for all of the men and public opposition to laws against homosexual sex. The trial lead to the creation of the Wolfenden committee of government representatives, ministers, educators, and psychiatrists, which in 1957, published a report recommending the discontinuation of laws against homosexuality.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599607\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3594876\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>The report eventually led to the 1967 Sexual Offenses Act, which ended the criminalization of homosexual sex between consenting men over the age of 21 in Britain and Wales. In 1994, the age was lowered to 18, and in 2003, it was lowered to 16, the same age for consenting heterosexual sex.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. history is slightly different from Britain&#8217;s. The fervent prosecution of gay sex didn&#8217;t start to happen in earnest until the very period during which Turing lived. The U.S. had anti-sodomy laws inherited from the English settlers, but it wasn&#8217;t until the late 1930s, 40s and 50s, during a period coinciding with the World Wars and a strong strain of Christian morality, that police in the U.S. made it a priority to enforce laws against homosexuals.<\/p>\n<p>As in England, concerns that homosexuals could be blackmailed by Communist spies&mdash;an idea popularized by Senator Joe McCarthy&mdash;drove some of the fervor against homosexuals during that period. In the U.S.&mdash;more so than in Britain, it seems&mdash;the period was marked by increased police enforcement of the laws. Police officers went undercover in public parks where homosexuals went to meet each other for sexual encounters, in order to uncover them. It was a period of fear for homosexuals in America unparalleled before or since. &#8220;This is the height of what I call the homosexual terror in America,&#8221; said William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School and the author of<em> Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596961\/review-the-imitation-game\/\" target=\"_blank\">TIME reviews <em>The Imitation Game<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>During this same period, Eskridge said, states began to pass laws that allowed courts to institutionalize gay people indefinitely in mental institutions for having &#8220;psychotic personalities,&#8221; where were experimented on, lobotomized, and given shock therapy.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case with Turing, the prosecution of gays also denied the U.S. some very bright minds who, but for their homosexuality, might have been allowed to contribute more to society. In the late 1950&#8242;s, Frank Kameny, an astronomer with a Ph.D. from Harvard, was kicked out of the Army Map Service and barred from serving in theUS government because he was a homosexual.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of geniuses of 20th century, the father of modern computers who helped win World War II, who was a lovely person, was destroyed by the anti homosexual terror,&#8221; Eskridge said of Turing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3558879\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-share\" data-name=\"rr-share\"><span class=\"social-links\">\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-mail social-link-mail\" href=\"mailto:?subject=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%20%7C%20TIME&body=The%20History%20Behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s%20The%20Imitation%20Game%0A%0AAlan%20Turing%20wasn%27t%20the%20only%20one%20who%20suffered%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"email\" title=\"Click to Email this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-fb social-link-fb popup\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F\" data-event=\"fb-share\" title=\"Click to post this article to Facebook\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-tw social-link-tw popup\" href=\"#\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp5HMd-f6qb&text=The%20history%20behind%20Benedict%20Cumberbatch%27s%20The%20Imitation%20Game&via=TIMEHistory\" data-event=\"tweet\" title=\"Click to Tweet this article\"><\/a>\n    <a class=\"time-icons time-icons-linkedin social-link-linkedin popup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3599607%2Fimitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing%2F&title=The+History+Behind+Benedict+Cumberbatch%E2%80%99s+The+Imitation+Game\" data-event=\"linkedin\" title=\"Click to post this article to LinkedIn\"><\/a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"time-icons time-icons-comment toggle-comments\" data-lf-site-id=\"314099\" data-lf-article-id=\"3599607\" data-url=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599607\/imitation-game-accuracy-benedict-cumberbatch-alan-turing\/\" data-title=\"The History Behind Benedict Cumberbatch&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;\/i&gt;\" title=\"Click to view and post comments\" data-event=\"comment-click\">0<\/a>\n<\/span>\n<\/aside>","section":{"name":"History","slug":"history","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/history\/","description":"The news in context, from the archives of TIME.

It&#8217;s hard to consider Whitaker a reliable reporter considering what he has left out; his standards are not only unrealistic, but also unwise and irresponsible for a biographer who wants to present a complete picture of his subject.<\/p>\n<p>Biographers know that circumstantial evidence is as valid&mdash;and perhaps as necessary&mdash;for inclusion as direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence accumulates at a certain level. Rarely do rapists assault their victims in front of witnesses. Is Whitaker suggesting that all biographers ignore detailed rape charges issued by women&mdash;ones who identify themselves, no less&mdash;against iconic, influential, wealthy men because nobody else was in the room?<\/p>\n<p>Many of the alleged violent encounters between Cosby and various women occurred more than a decade before publication of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography. In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit in a Philadelphia court; on the heels of her charges, twelve other women came forward, ready to testify on behalf of the plaintiff that they had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. The then-prosecutor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2014\/11\/19\/prosecutor-who-declined-to-charge-bill-cosby-in-2005-i-didnt-say-that-he-didnt-commit-the-crime\/\" target=\"_blank\">decided there was not sufficient evidence<\/a> to criminally charge Cosby&mdash;&#8221;I remember thinking that he probably did do something inappropriate,&#8221; the lawyer recently said, &ldquo;But thinking that and being able to prove it are two different things&rdquo;&mdash;but Cosby settled a civil suit with Constand.<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, journalist Robert Huber published a painstakingly detailed article, &ldquo;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.phillymag.com\/articles\/dr-huxtable-mr-hyde\/\">Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde<\/a>,&rdquo; in Philadelphia magazine about the litigation. Other journalists have reported responsibly about the allegations. If Whitaker had at minimum simply mentioned the findings of those journalists in his book, he might have escaped the criticism now aimed at him.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, many potential and actual readers of Whitaker&rsquo;s biography idolize Cosby. And yes, some of them&mdash;a tiny minority, I believe&mdash;prefer sanitized biography. Hagiography, if you will. No drunken bouts, no snorting cocaine, and certainly nothing involving sexual acts&mdash;especially rape.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599631\"><\/div>\n<p>But responsible biographers never set out to produce hagiography or pathography. They set out to find truth. That may sound inflated; after all, many of us do not really <em>know<\/em> our parents, our spouses, our children, our cousins, our social friends. If those folks surprise us, for better or for worse, can we ever know a stranger? Armand Hammer was elderly but alive while I researched his biography during the 1980s. He expressed hostility from the start, threatened to sue me, and did indeed sue me and the publisher. I never met him. So how can I presume to know the truth about his controversial life?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is not so complicated. Pieces of the truth are scattered around the world&mdash;in official government documents at the city, county, state and federal levels; in business correspondence; in personal letters; in interviews with relatives and friends and enemies, current and former. I knew Hammer&rsquo;s son Julian had personal problems, but I was not planning to provide lots of detail to readers. Then my research turned up evidence that Julian had killed a man in college. At trial, he won an acquittal, possibly because of influence exercised by his father in relation to the prosecutor and one or more of the jurors. I included the death in my book. First, all individuals, including Armand Hammer, who choose to become parents should be evaluated in that role. Second, the possibility of tampering with the criminal justice system certainly allows for a more nuanced understanding of the alleged tamperer&rsquo;s character.<\/p>\n<p>I liken the information-gathering process to vacuuming a house&mdash;everything finds its way into the vacuum bag. When the bag is filled, the biographer examines the contents, deciding what to place in the book and what to omit. The decision-making might seem filled with conundrums, but it should be clear-cut if the overriding purpose is to illuminate an individual&rsquo;s character on the path to truth. That overriding purpose should be the same whether the subject is cooperating with the biographer, as Cosby did with Whitaker, or whether the subject is hostile, as Hammer was with me. And access should not equal acquiescence.<\/p>\n<p>At minimum, Whitaker should have decided that the multiple allegations of sexual assault affected Cosby&rsquo;s own life so deeply that they needed to be included in the book. Based on his evaluation of the evidence, Whitaker could have told readers that he doubted the allegations. Or he could have told readers that the allegations existed&mdash;an objective fact. Whatever Whitaker concluded about the evidence, he needed to tell readers how Cosby reacted, and why he might have reacted as he did. Instead, Whitaker participated in a biographical cover-up&mdash;a classic lie of omission. That is never an acceptable decision for the chronicler of somebody else&rsquo;s life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/journalism.missouri.edu\/staff\/steve-weinberg\/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Weinberg<\/a>, Professor Emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, has published biographies of Armand Hammer and Ida Tarbell, plus written a book about the craft of biography, T<\/em>elling the Untold Story<em>.

When I considered my Cosby experience alongside the actor&#8217;s on-screen persona, a doctor and family man who combined life lessons with old-fashioned humor, I intuitively knew that he couldn&#8217;t be a serial rapist.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"http:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/timeinterstellarcover.jpg?w=560\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547827\/the-art-of-science\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\"><em>Interstellar<\/em>, Where No Movie Has Gone Before<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547825\/nucor-tries-to-reverse-decline-in-american-steelmaking\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">The Last Men of Steel<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3547828\/review-interstellar-christopher-nolan\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Review: <em>Interstellar\u2019s<\/em> Wonder of Worlds Beyond<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>But eventually emotion gave way to reason. Seven women with little to gain have reported that Cosby committed the same heinous crime, rape, in the same way. So if someone like me, a life long fan, believes these women, where does that leave <i>The <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>osby Show<\/i>? Are all of Cosby&rsquo;s indelible life lessons suddenly moot? Does secretly watching an episode when no one is around condone sex crimes?<\/p>\n<p>To help me think through these questions, I turned to ethicists and academics.<\/p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s the question of morality versus art. To condemn his actions, do I also have to repudiate the man and his work? I took this up with Jeremy David Fix, a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Safra Center for Ethics who studies moral philosophy: Would continuing to watch <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>harm anyone, even indirectly?<\/p>\n<p>(<strong>MORE:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3599978\/cosby-show-reruns-rape\/\" target=\"_blank\">So What Do We Do About <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>?<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>On the one hand, watching the show helps in some small way line Bill Cosby&#8217;s pockets via residuals. On the other hand, with an estimated net worth of over $350 million at the age 77, he can already rest assured that he&rsquo;ll live the rest of his life comfortably. But Harvard&#8217;s Fix asks a good question: What about the women who have been assaulted&mdash;what sort of message does it send if I keep supporting Cosby, even indirectly? I had to give up watching, I started to conclude. Otherwise, I might inadvertently send the signal that I think sexual assault is something that can be treated flippantly.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3599394\"><\/div>\n<p>But how do I weigh the message that watching the show might send victims against the still-needed message that it sends to America at-large about race? I had finally stumped Fix. So I turned to historians and other thinkers to talk about the show&#8217;s legacy and whether i still has a positive role to play in discussions about race.<\/p>\n<p>Joe Feagin, a sociologist who has written about <em>The Cosby Show<\/em>, talks eloquently about the indelible impression the show left on the country. Black Americans tend to celebrate the achievement of a top-rated show featuring a black cast in a positive light. They will probably keep doing that even if they condemn its creator. White Americans tend to celebrate the show as evidence that African-Americans can succeed in middle class life, Feagin said. While that view leaves society&#8217;s entrenched racism unaddressed, I&#8217;d still take Cosby over the <em>Sanford and Son<\/em>. Let&#8217;s face it, American residential communities are still largely racially homogenous, and it would certainly benefit future generations to see black families like the Huxtables.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried to convince myself that somehow we could condemn Cosby&#8217;s rape message while continuing to watch the show. That is, I hoped we could separate Cliff Huxtable from Bill Cosby. But in the end, I don&#8217;t think we can any more. The two are so closely linked that as I tried to watch an episode of <i>The Cosby Show <\/i>this week, the image of Cliff kept reminding me of the actor&#8217;s pathetic <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3596545\/cosby-responds-rape-allegations-ap-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">silence<\/a> in response to questions about the accusations him. If that distracted me, I can only imagine how an assault survivor would feel. The show has positively affected millions of Americans, and that legacy remains intact, but maybe it&#8217;s time for a new show to teach us about race. It&#8217;s a little overdue anyway.<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\" id=\"right-rail-ad-3599394\"><\/div><\/aside><aside

starting when she was 15. Hill says that at the age, she began an on-again, off-again relationship with Cosby, who would offer her drinks that Hill now believes were drugged.<\/p>\n<div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"body-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"main-white\">\n<section class=\"page-columns\">\n<section class=\"two-column columns-left\">\n<article id=\"main-story\">\n<div class=\"story\">\n<p>&ldquo;One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Hill told<em> CBS Pittsburgh<\/em>. &ldquo;I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned, you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hill eventually ended the relationship when she was 19, despite Cosby paying for Hill&rsquo;s college tuition.<\/p>\n<p>Another woman, Kristina Ruehli, also alleges that she was drugged by Cosby when she was 22, working at a talent agency assistant at Artists Agency Corp, where he was then a client.

Centric is available in 51 million homes. Asked for the channel&rsquo;s reasoning behind the decision, a spokesperson replied that they&rsquo;re not making any comments about the series at this time.<span id=\"more-194062\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The other channel is called Aspire and it was launched by Magic Johnson in 2012. Aspire airs Cosby&rsquo;s short-lived 1969 sitcom, <em>The Bill Cosby Show<\/em>, which ran for two seasons. Aspire told EW, &ldquo;We continue to closely monitor the situation. Currently the show is still running.&rdquo; Aspire is available in about 21 million homes.<\/p>\n<p>Nine women have recently accused Cosby of drugging and raping them during the 1970s and &rsquo;80s, allegations the 77-year-old comic has strongly denied through his attorney. In recent weeks, Cosby has canceled at least two TV appearances, NBC has halted development on a new sitcom starring the actor and Netflix has postponed streaming a new Cosby stand-up special.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/insidetv.ew.com\/2014\/11\/21\/cosby-show-repeats\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>This article originally appeared on Entertainment Weekly<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<aside
